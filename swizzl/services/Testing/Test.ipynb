      "https://news.yahoo.com/photos-hong-kong-police-storm-university-held-by-protesters-192615683.html\n",
      " \" Police breached a Hong Kong university campus held by protesters early Monday after an all-night siege that included firing repeated barrages of tear gas and water cannons.Anti-government protesters have barricaded themselves inside Hong Kong Polytechnic University for days. Police surrounded the area Sunday night and began moving in after issuing an ultimatum for people to leave the area. The crowd wore raincoats and carried umbrellas to shield themselves.Riot officers broke in one entrance before dawn as fires raged inside and outside the school, but they didn’t appear to get very far. Fiery explosions could be seen as protesters responded with gasoline bombs. Police, who have warned that everyone in the area could be charged with rioting, reportedly made a handful of arrests.At daybreak, protesters remained in control of most of the campus. In one outdoor area, some demonstrators made gasoline bombs while others dozed while wearing gas masks. Two walked about with bows and quivers of arrows, while many stared at their smartphones.A lull settled on the area as the president of the university said in a video message that that police have agreed to suspend their use of force.Jin-Guang Teng said police would allow protesters to leave and he would accompany them to the police station to ensure their cases would be processed fairly.“I hope that you will accept the proposed temporary suspension of force and leave the campus in a peaceful manner,” he said.It seemed unlikely the protesters would accept the offer given that they would all likely be arrested.A few hundred streamed out of the campus about 8:15 a.m. in an apparent bid to escape, but they were driven back by police tear gas. Some wearing gas masks calmly picked up smoking tear gas canisters and dropped them into heavy-duty bags, but the protesters decided to retreat with a phalanx of officers lined up across the road in the distance.On Sunday, protesters used bows and arrows, and one arrow struck a media liaison officer in the calf. Photos on the department’s Facebook page show the arrow sticking out of the back of the officer’s leg through his pants.As riot police moved in from all sides, some protesters retreated inside the university. Others set fires on bridges leading to it.A huge blaze burned along much of a long footbridge that connects a train station to the campus over the approach to the Cross-Harbour Tunnel, a major road under Hong Kong’s harbor that has been blocked by protesters for days.The use of bows and arrows and gasoline bombs was a sharp escalation of violence by the protesters, who are trying to keep the pressure on Hong Kong leaders, who have rejected most of their demands.The protests started peacefully in early June, sparked by proposed legislation that would have criminal suspects to be extradited to the mainland. But by the time the bill was withdrawn, the protests had hardened and broadened into a resistance movement against the territory’s government and Beijing.Activists see the extradition bill as an example of Hong Kong’s eroding autonomy under Beijing rule since the 1997 handover from colonial power Britain.

      " \" Four people were killed and six more wounded when “unknown suspects” sneaked into a backyard filled with people at a party in central California and fired into the crowd, police said.The shooting took place about 6 p.m. on the Fresno’s southeast side, where people were gathered to watch a football game, Fresno Police Lt. Bill Dooley said.Deputy Chief Michael Reid told the Fresno Bee and the KSEE/KGPE TV stations that a total of 10 people were shot, with three found dead in the backyard. A fourth person died at the hospital. Six others are expected to survive and are recovering at the hospital.All the victims were Asian men ranging from ages 25 to 35, Reid said.“What we do know is that this was a gathering, a family and friend gathering in the backyard,” Dooley said. “Everyone was watching football this evening when unknown suspects approached the residence, snuck into the backyard and opened fire.”The victims were taken to Community Regional Medical Center in critical condition, and some are now stable, the TV stations reported.About 35 people were at the party when the shooting began, Reid said.“Thank God that no kids were hurt,” he said.No one is in custody in connection with the shooting. Police said there was no immediate indication that the victims knew the shooter or shooters.Police were going door-to-door in search of surveillance video that might help them track down the suspects. The shooting took place about a half-mile from the city’s airport.

      "https://news.yahoo.com/israeli-military-says-4-rockets-064125063.html\n",
      " \" JERUSALEM (AP) — The Israeli military said it intercepted four incoming rockets from Syria on Tuesday and explosions were heard shortly after that in Damascus, a week after another Israeli strike targeted a top Palestinian militant in the Syrian capital.Israeli air defense systems captured the projectiles, the military said, and no harm was caused to Israeli communities in the Golan Heights after warning sirens awoke residents there early in the morning. There was no immediate official comment from Syria but the SANA state news agency reported explosions were heard near Damascus International Airport, indicating a potential Israeli retaliatory strike.The Israeli military would not comment on the explosions in Syria, but Defense Minister Naftali Bennett was convening the top military brass in Tel Aviv to discuss the latest developments.Speaking on Israel Army Radio, Foreign Minister Israel Katz was equally vague, saying only that “Israel will act in the way it sees fit.”The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Israel targeted posts southwest of Damascus with five missiles, adding that Syrian air defenses shot down some of the missiles. The war monitor said Lebanon's Hezbollah fighters are active in the area that was struck and that there was no immediate word on casualties.The Observatory said the area targeted near Damascus is where the four missiles were fired from earlier toward the Golan Heights.The rare rocket fire comes a week after an Israeli airstrike against a top Palestinian militant based in Syria. Akram al-Ajouri, a member of the leadership of the militant Islamic Jihad group who is living in exile, survived the attack but his son and granddaughter were killed.Israel frequently strikes Iranian interests in Syria. But last week’s airstrike appeared to be a rare assassination attempt of a Palestinian militant in the Syrian capital. It came the same day as another Israeli airstrike killed a senior Islamic Jihad commander in Gaza, settling off the fiercest round of fighting there in years.It all comes amid heightened tensions between Israel and Iranian proxies along its borders. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has issued a series of warnings recently about Iranian aggression throughout the Middle East.Iran has forces based in Syria, Israel's northern neighbor, and supports Hezbollah militants in Lebanon. In Gaza, it supplies Islamic Jihad with cash, weapons and expertise.Netanyahu also has claimed Iran is using Iraq and far-off Yemen, where Tehran supports Shiite Houthi rebels at war with a Saudi-led coalition backing the government, to plan attacks against Israel. Hamas also receives some support from Iran.At the same time, Iran's regional influence is being challenged by unprecedented, economically-driven mass protests in Iraq and Lebanon — two countries where Tehran wields major influence. The protests are creating unrest that Tehran fears would spark a backlash against Iran-backed proxy militias in those countries.Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has accused the U.S. and its regional allies of fomenting the Iraq and Lebanon unrest.____Associated Press writer Bassem Mroue contributed from Beirut. \" \n",

      "https://news.yahoo.com/volker-testify-unaware-effort-investigate-131840956.html\n",
      " \" Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, will testify Tuesday that he was unaware of any direct link between military aid to Ukraine and investigations into Burisma and Hunter Biden, the New York Times reported Tuesday.Volker will add that he was unaware that U.S. ambassador to the E.U. Gordon Sondland told the Ukrainians that aid was conditioned on the investigations, and that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was being pressed to appear on CNN and announce that he would open the investigations.During his closed-door deposition last month, Volker testified that he warned President Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani that information regarding corruption allegations against Joe and Hunter Biden wasn’t credible, and that he advised Ukrainian officials to steer clear of U.S. politics to avoid the impression they were interfering in U.S. elections.Volker told House lawmakers in October that he was not aware of any Ukrainian investigations into Hunter Biden, and plans to counter other testimony that he was intimately involved in discussions around Biden’s time at Burisma. He is expected to tell lawmakers that he never made an explicit connection between Biden and an investigation into Burisma since he was familiar with the energy company through his work in Ukraine rather than within the context of domestic politics.The former Ukraine special envoy also will testify that he does not remember the July 10 White House meeting in the same manner of others, who have previously testified that former National Security Adviser John Bolton ended the meeting abruptly after objecting to what he referred to as the “drug deal” involving the withholding of military aid in exchange for politically beneficial Ukrainian investigations.The day after Volker’s October testimony, House Democrats released texts between Volker, Sondland, and Bill Taylor, which show discussions over investigations in the buildup to a potential Trump-Zelensky meeting at the White House.The morning of the July 25 call, Volker texted Andriy Yermak, a top Ukrainian aide, saying “Heard from the White House—assuming President Z convinces Trump he will investigate/‘get to the bottom of what happened’ in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington.” \" \n",

      " \" Kiev (AFP) - Ukraine's former president Petro Poroshenko has been designated a witness in a criminal investigation related to the nomination of judges, the state investigation bureau said on Monday.Poroshenko has been embroiled in a number of investigations since leaving office in May.But the latest investigation is the first abuse of power probe involving the former president, his office said.\\\"His status is that of a witness,\\\" a spokeswoman for the state investigation bureau, which handles high-profile cases, told AFP.If Poroshenko's status changed to that of suspect, he could be prosecuted if parliament voted to lift his immunity as a lawmaker.If that happened, and he was convicted of abuse of power and calls to overthrow the government, he could face up to six years in prison.- 'Intimidation' attempt -Poroshenko's office denounced the bureau's announcement as an attack sponsored by arch-enemy Moscow to \\\"damage\\\" his reputation.Later Poroshenko himself condemned the probe as an attempt \\\"to intimidate\\\" him but stressed the attack would fail.\\\"It is important to find organisers of this provocation. Their goal is to intimidate our team,\\\" Poroshenko told journalists.\\\"I want to emphasise that nothing will work out for you.\\\"According to a statement released by the state investigation bureau, the 54-year-old former president is suspected of trying to \\\"illegally influence\\\" the makeup of the High Council of Justice earlier this year.The council is a state body which picks judges who are then appointed by the president.Prosecutor-General Ruslan Ryaboshapka said his agency \\\"was considering\\\" the case before deciding whether to ask parliament to lift Poroshenko's immunity.Ukraine's president between 2014 and 2019, Poroshenko was routed by Volodymyr Zelensky, a 41-year-old comedian with no pervious political experience, in an election in April.Poroshenko is now a lawmaker in a parliament dominated by Zelensky's ruling party.The head of the state investigation bureau, Roman Truba, has said that Poroshenko has been named as a witness in a dozen criminal investigations including a probe into alleged tax fraud.The probes were opened following allegations of a former senior official, Andriy Portnov, Poroshenko's foe who lived in Russia and Austria during his presidency.Portnov is a close friend of Andriy Bogdan, head of Zelensky's administration.Ukrainian media reported that Portnov visited Zelensky's office on Monday, but on a different matter. \" \n",

      " \" WASHINGTON – Pete Buttigieg's presidential campaign responded Monday to criticism over its use of a stock image of a Kenyan woman on a campaign webpage promoting the South Bend, Indiana, mayor's plan to address racial inequality. Buttigieg spokesman Sean Savett said in a tweet that the photograph was taken down \\\"months ago as part of a regular update.\\\" \\\"We apologize for its use and for the confusion it created,\\\" Savett said, noting that the use of stock photos is \\\"standard practice across many campaigns.\\\" He said that the image was selected by a contractor and that the website it was taken from did not make clear that the photo was taken in Kenya.In July, Buttigieg unveiled \\\"The Douglass Plan\\\" – named in honor of abolitionist hero Frederick Douglass – which his website describes as \\\"a comprehensive and intentional dismantling of racist structures and systems.\\\" To achieve that goal, it promises changes to the criminal justice and health care systems, as well as an expansion of investment and credit in black communities. The Intercept reported Friday that three South Carolina politicians, who were included in a list of more than 400 South Carolinians supporting the plan and promoted by the campaign, said they had been mischaracterized as endorsing Buttigieg. Johnnie Cordero, chair of the state party’s Black Caucus, said he never backed the plan. which he called \\\"entirely presumptuous.\\\" Ryan Grim, The Intercept's D.C. bureau chief who wrote the article, tweeted Friday, \\\"On top of everything else, the Buttigieg campaign used a stock photo from Kenya to promote its Frederick Douglass Plan for Black America.\\\" On top of everything else, the Buttigieg campaign used a stock photo from Kenya to promote its Frederick Douglass Plan for Black America https://t.co/OqnGSIqCLS pic.twitter.com/qBqei71TdAThis is not ok or necessary 🤦🏽‍♀️ https://t.co/H9hvQkVWxp \" \n",

      " \" Key Point: An old sub could make a comeback. On April 20, 2019, Russia’s TASS Agency reported that Vice Admiral Oleg Burtsev announced Russia’s intention to take two of its decommissioned Typhoon-class ballistic submarines and pack them full of hundreds of cruise missiles.“The dimensions of these submarines allow arming each of them with at least 200 cruise missiles [each],” he said.The Typhoon ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs), famously featured in the film Hunt for Red October, are by far the biggest and most expensive submarines ever built. Cruise-missile-armed Typhoons would give Russia direct analogs of the United States’ four Ohio-class cruise missile submarines (SSGNs), which had their launch tubes for nuclear-armed ballistic missiles replaced with vertical launch systems for 154 conventionally-armed Tomahawk cruise missiles.Burtsev made the missile-envy issue explicit:“American Ohio-class submarines can carry 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles and Chinese Project 055 destroyer is capable of carrying 112 cruise missiles. But our frigates belonging to the Project 22350 can currently carry only 16 of them. Subsequent frigates will get 24 of them. It is still insufficient,” he added.But there’s a big problem this plan—revamping the two mothballed subs would likely cost more than simply building newer, better submarines for the job.The Typhoon and KalibrThe Typhoon-class submarine, officially designated the Project 941 Akula (“Shark”) in Russia, are Cold War behemoths measuring 175-meters in length and displacing 48,000 ton submerged. That amounts to twice the tonnage of American Ohio-class SSBN it was intended to rival. No less than five internal pressure hulls made of ultra-expensive titanium gave the Typhoon’s extraordinary resilience to battle damage—and extraordinary cost to manufacture.The Typhoons were designed to lurk under the ice of the Arctic Circle, covered by friendly Soviet naval forces, awaiting a very-low-frequency radio signal indicating that World War III had broken out and had gone nuclear. In that event, they’d rise close to the surface, counting on their reinforced sails to smash through the ice if necessary, and launch their twenty R-39 ballistic missiles. Each missile, in turn, would unleash ten independently targeted 100-kiloton yield nuclear warheads on American and European cities and military bases.Only one Typhoon remains operational today, TK-208 Dimitriy Donskoi, which has been employed on occasional missile tests. Three others, plus another Typhoon which was laid down and never completed, were scrapped between 2005 and 2009, an operation 80 percent funded with U.S. and Canadian money. Smaller, newer and stealthier Borei­-class SSBNs, as well as older Delta-class boats, perform Russian nuclear deterrence patrols instead—at half the operating and maintenance cost of the Typhoons.The two Typhoons being proposed for refit are the decommissioned TK-17 Arkhangelsk and TK-20 Severstal, which have been rusting in an Arctic ship repair center at Severodvinsk since 2006 and 2004 respectively. For over a decade, the Russian Navy repeatedly announced intentions to either scrap or refit the subs as recently as 2018, only to apparently change its mind.The idea of arming the Typhoons with cruise missiles and mines, instead of new ballistic missiles, has been kicked around for a while. The Typhoons have even been considered for use as submarine cargo ships for circumventing Arctic ice.Burtsev stated that Kalibr­ cruise missiles would be the Typhoon SSGN’s principle armament, but also suggested more advanced Zircon and hypersonic Oniks missile currently under development could also be equipped.The Kalibr is Russia’s analog of the U.S. Tomahawk cruise missile. It comes in a submarine-launched 3M14K land-attack and 3M54K radar-guided anti-ship variants, with ranges of 1,600 and 400 miles respectively. Unlike the subsonic Tomahawk, the anti-ship 3M54 model can dash nearly three times the speed of sound on its terminal approach to evade missile defenses. On at least nine occasions between 2015-2018, Russian  Kilo-class submarines have fired subsonic 3M14K Kalibr missile through their torpedo tubes at land targets in Syria.The P-800 Oniks is a more advanced supersonic anti-ship missile in service on new Yasen-class submarines, while Zircon is a hypersonic weapon with a reported top speed of Mach 9 that has yet to be integrated onto a submarine platform.Costs Meet BenefitsThe idea of a gigantic submarine ripple-firing two hundred cruise missiles at NATO bases or a carrier task force sounds intimidating. But just how realistic is a cruise-missile refit?Submarine analyst Peter Coates notes in a blog post the major challenges revamping the Typhoons would pose.The Soviet Navy would have to “treat and/or derust each Typhoon’s massive steel outer hull and Titanium inner hulls. Russia may have lost the highly expensive industrial capability to work Titanium for submarines.”Russia would also have to develop modernized combat systems and sensors, particularly for targeting the cruise missiles, as well as heavily retrofit the 2.4-meter diameter ballistic missile tubes to pack in twenty cruise missiles each. Then, there is the matter of the Typhoon’s two thirty-three-year-old nuclear reactors, which would likely need to be replaced entirely.Lastly, cruise missiles like the Kalibr, priced at $1.2 million each, are fantastically expensive even for the U.S. military, and Russia has roughly one-twelfth the defense budget. Concentrating two-hundred missiles on one submarine, rather than dispersing them across Russia’s many Kalibr-compatible launch platforms, may not be a sensible or affordable way to use the limited supply of costly missiles.In short, Coates, notes that it would likely be cheaper to build two entirely new, modern submarines—say, a modified Borei-class—than to refit the enormous Typhoons.Michael Kofman, a Russia-specialist at the Center for Naval Analysis, stated the same thing: “It sounds quite unrealistic… the project doesn’t make sense given the cost of refitting an SSGN or a ship to a SSGN is often equal to the price of building an entirely new one.”Coates points out that Russia already possesses many submarines that can launch smaller cruise missile attacks, and is upgrading several Project 949AM Oscar-class submarines with the capability of lobbing up to sixty-four cruise missiles through their vertical launch cells on their spine.Thus, while the idea of Russia reviving its cold war leviathans sounds compellingly scary, there’s evidence it makes little practical or financial sense given more cost-efficient and survivable means to achieve the same ends. It could also be the project is being trumpeted for the propagandistic symbolism behind deploying super-submarines that are larger and carry more missiles than their American counterparts.However, in the last few years, the Russian Navy has had to walk back hyped-up plans to develop nuclear-powered Lider-class destroyers, a new aircraft carrier, and air-independent propulsion systems for its diesel submarines.Furthermore, in November 2018 the huge PD-50 floating drydock specifically built to maintain the gigantic Typhoons (and then adapted to tend to carriers and missile cruisers) sank in an accident, with significant implications for the sustainability of large naval assets.Therefore, it’s probably sensible to await more concrete evidence the Russian Navy is ready to follow through with the considerable money and effort necessary to revamp its moth-balled mega-subs.As Kremlin state news agency RIA Novosti/Sputnik News put it in an article that ran January 2018:“At first glance, the idea of equipping Akulas with cruise missiles looks attractive... But those [benefits] pale compared to the costs of restoring and operating Severstal and Arkhangelsk…”“Arkhangelsk” and “Severstal” could be converted to cruise missiles, but the usefulness of this solution at its very high cost is not obvious, says [Russian naval anlalyst] Konstantin Makienko, “we have quite a lot of platforms for cruise missiles that are much cheaper and more mobile.”Sébastien Roblin holds a master’s degree in conflict resolution from Georgetown University and served as a university instructor for the Peace Corps in China.

      "https://news.yahoo.com/u-increased-sea-patrols-send-082722417.html\n",
      " \" (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. is conducting more patrols in the South China Sea to send a signal to China that it intends to maintain freedom in the area that’s crucial for global trade, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Tuesday.Esper said at a media briefing in Manila the U.S. “rejects attempts by any nation to use coercion or intimidation to advance international interests at the expense of others.”He also urged nations with South China Sea claims to take a public position and assert sovereign rights to get China “on the right path.”“The clear signal we’re trying to send is not that we’re opposing China per se, but we all stand for international law, and that we think China should abide by them as well,” Esper said.Esper said the U.S. has conducted “more freedom of navigation operations in the past year or so than we did have in the past 20-plus years.”While Esper didn’t elaborate, the U.S. has confirmed at least five so-called freedom of navigation operations to challenge excessive maritime claims in the Spratly and Paracel island chains, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the same number that were publicly reported in 2018.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang hit back at a separate briefing in Beijing, saying the U.S. has long sought to “fan the flames” and create “chaos in the South China Sea.” Geng added that China was working with regional countries to ensure stability and urged the U.S. to stop acting as a “disruptor.”In Manila Esper also said the U.S. remains committed to the 68-year-old defense treaty that binds it to come to the Philippines’ aid in case of an armed attack on its territory. The treaty applies to the South China Sea, he added.The Philippines is discussing with the U.S. how the defense treaty can be made clearer, Philippine Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said. He added that the two nations’ relationship had “suffered setbacks” but remained enduring.Esper also pledged to continue supporting Philippine military upgrades and counter-terrorism efforts and said it was good to clarify the defense treaty to respond to changing times.(Updates with comments from Esper, China’s Foreign Ministry in grafs 5-7)--With assistance from Peter Martin.To contact the reporters on this story: Andreo Calonzo in Manila at acalonzo1@bloomberg.net;Glen Carey in Manila at gcarey8@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Cecilia Yap at cyap19@bloomberg.net, Muneeza NaqviFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P. \" \n",

      " \" AP Photo/Morry GashFormer President Barack Obama waded into the Democratic primary last Friday, warning Democratic donors that 2020 candidates shouldn't push for policies that would fundamentally restructure American society.\\\"Even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality and the fact that voters, including the Democratic voters and certainly persuadable independents or even moderate Republicans, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain, you know, left-leaning Twitter feeds, or the activist wing of our party,\\\" Obama said at an event in Washington, according to CBS News. He added that most Americans are more interested in \\\"improvement\\\" than \\\"revolutionary\\\" change. \\\"The average American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it,\\\" he said. Obama argued that while there's a place for activists pushing Democrats to the left, the presidential nominee needs to appeal to a broad swath of the public. The comments, the most strongly-worded Obama has yet to make about the 2020 primary, were an implicit rebuke of Sen. Bernie Sanders' call for a \\\"political revolution\\\" and Sen. Elizabeth Warren's campaign for \\\"big, structural change.\\\" And they suggested that Obama stands behind former Vice President Joe Biden's more moderate approach in the primary.Obama didn't name any candidate, but he did mention healthcare and immigration as issues where Democratic candidates have offered policy solutions that he thinks are too radical for the average voter. \\\"I don't think we should be deluded into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven't heard a bold enough proposal and if they hear something as bold as possible then immediately that's going to activate them,\\\" Obama said.The former president noted that he supports competitive primaries and said the nominee will be strengthened in a general election by having endured months of tough campaigning. \\\"For those who get stressed about robust primaries, I just have to remind you I had a very robust primary,\\\" he said. \\\"I'm confident that at the end of the process we will have a candidate that has been tested.\\\"NOW WATCH: Extremists turned a frog meme into a hate symbol, but Hong Kong protesters revived it as an emblem of hope \" \n",

      " \" MADRID (AP) — A Spanish National Court official confirmed Monday that a former Venezuelan spymaster accused of attempting to \\\"flood\\\" the United States with drugs remains missing since an order for his arrest pending extradition was issued this month.The official said the order for Maj. Gen. Hugo Carvajal’s arrest in Madrid was issued Nov. 8, after the court reversed an earlier ruling that rejected the U.S. extradition request for allegedly being politically motivated.He said Carvajal has yet to be located. The official spoke on condition of anonymity under court rules.Carvajal was for over a decade the eyes and ears in the military of late Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez.Carvajal had been free on bail with his passport confiscated following the initial ruling. Failure to locate him has been seen as very embarrassing for Spanish authorities.The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ties Carvajal to a 5.6-ton cocaine shipment busted in Mexico in 2006 and accuse him of aiding and protecting Colombian guerrillas.In the extradition ruling released Monday but dated Nov. 8, the court rejected the earlier decision and said the case involved “continued and organized behavior in relation to drug trafficking over 20 years.”Should Carvajal be located and arrested, the final word on his extradition will still lie with the Spanish government.There was no immediate comment from Carvajal's lawyer.The U.S. had been seeking Carvajal's extradition since the former head of Venezuela's military intelligence fled to Spain in late March after publicly supporting the opposition's efforts to oust Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.Prosecutors in New York say Carvajal should face trial for \\\"narcoterrorism\\\" as part of a group of Venezuelan officials who were charged with \\\"flooding\\\" the U.S. with drugs. \" \n",

      "https://news.yahoo.com/israel-intercepts-rocket-fire-syria-reportedly-hits-back-091836779.html\n",
      " \" Jerusalem (AFP) - Israel's air defences intercepted four rockets fired from neighbouring Syria on Tuesday, the army said, prompting reported retaliatory missile strikes against the source of the fire.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the rockets were fired from positions around the capital held by groups loyal to the Damascus government.It did not elaborate on which group had launched the rockets or whether there had been any casualties in the retaliatory strikes.The flareup comes after a major escalation in and around Gaza last week following Israel's targeted killing of a commander of Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad, which is allied with Damascus.The killing was accompanied by a second strike, unconfirmed by Israel, on an Islamic Jihad leader in Damascus that killed his son and another person.There was no immediate rocket fire from Syria following that strike.\\\"Four launches were identified from Syria towards Israeli territory which were intercepted by the Israeli air defence systems,\\\" the Israeli military said in a statement.\\\"No hits on Israeli communities were identified.\\\"Meanwhile, blasts were heard close to the airport in the Syrian capital Damascus, the state SANA news agency reported.It gave no further details but the Observatory reported \\\"missile fire by Israeli aircraft on positions south and southwest of Damascus\\\".Syrian air defences opened fire in response, the Britain-based war monitor said.\\\"The Israeli bombardment targeted positions held by pro-regime groups who launched the missiles against Israel,\\\" Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP.Israel has carried out frequent air and missile strikes against targets inside Syria since the country descended into civil war in 2011.Most have been against what Israel said were Iranian targets or positions of Iran's Lebanese ally, Shiite militant group Hezbollah.Both are sworn enemies of Israel and both have backed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces with advisers or fighters.Israel has also carried out some strikes targeting Palestinian rejectionist factions based in Damascus, like last week's strike that Islamic Jihad said targeted one of its leaders.Islamic Jihad joined other militant groups in agreeing a fragile new UN- and Egyptian-brokered truce around Gaza after last week's two-day flareup.It came after senior Islamic Jihad leader Baha Abu Al-Ata, whom Israel blamed for recent rocket fire into its territory, was killed in a strike on his home in Gaza City.In response Islamic Jihad, which is allied with Gaza's rulers Hamas, fired around 450 rockets towards Israel, which struck back with more air strikes.The flareup saw 34 Palestinians and no Israelis killed.A ceasefire between Israel and militant groups including Islamic Jihad was agreed after 50 hours of clashes, but the deal remains precarious. \" \n",

      " \" As he eyes a potential bid for president, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg apologized over the weekend for \\\"stop-and-frisk,\\\" sparking a backlash from the current mayor, Bill de Blasio, who says the apology comes at a politically convenient time.Bloomberg made his apology on Sunday while speaking at a black church. The former mayor, who has opened the door to a possible run for the Democratic nomination, said that \\\"hindsight is 20/20.\\\"\\\"I can't change history, however, today I want you to know that I realize back then I was wrong, and I'm sorry,\\\" Bloomberg said of the controversial policy, which critics say has been shown to affect people of color at disproportionately high rates. De Blasio, who reformed the policy as mayor in 2014 after a federal judge ruled it violated constitutional rights, told CNN that it \\\"seems awfully strange\\\" Bloomberg waited until now to apologize and that his timing is politically expedient.\\\"This is LONG overdue and the timing is transparent and cynical,\\\" de Blasio said on Twitter. \\\"With all due respect to my predecessor, we've spent six years undoing the damage he created with this bankrupt policy.\\\"“People aren’t stupid. They can figure out if someone is honestly addressing an issue or whether they’re acting out of convenience. … It seems awfully strange that it took until now.” @NYCMayor Bill de Blasio on Michael Bloomberg's \\\"Stop & Frisk\\\" apology today. pic.twitter.com/9mkxLwZQem\\\"I got something important really wrong. I didn't understand that back then, the full impact that stops were having on the black and Latino communities,\\\" Bloomberg said Sunday. \\\"I was totally focused on saving lives, but as we know good intentions aren't good enough.\\\"\\\"I'm looking at that and I just have to say, people aren't stupid. They can figure out if someone is honestly addressing an issue or whether they're acting out of convenience,\\\" de Blasio said. \\\"But to wait six whole years and only when it is a matter of need, I think that raises eyebrows,\\\" de Blasio also said. \\\"This is a death bed conversion,\\\"Bloomberg appealed the federal court's ruling at the time, a decision that was later dropped by de Blasio. And the former mayor has repeatedly defended the stop-and-frisk policy throughout the years, as de Blasio has drastically reduced its use. The New York Civil Liberties Union found that despite the decline of stops during de Blasio's time in office, racial disparities persist.Stop-and-frisk has also seen support from President Donald Trump, who last year suggested it be brought back in Chicago.“The fact is, far too many innocent people were being stopped while we tried [to save lives]. The overwhelming majority of them were black and Latino. That may have included, I’m sorry to say, some of you here today,\\\" Bloomberg said Sunday. He added he wants to rebuild trust with the communities affected.Both mayors have dipped their toes into the 2020 presidential race, with Bloomberg recently opening the door for an official run and de Blasio a voice in the Democratic primary before halting his campaign in September.Bloomberg has filed for the primaries in Alabama and Arkansas.This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Bill de Blasio: Michael Bloomberg's 'stop-and-frisk' apology overdue \" \n",

      "https://news.yahoo.com/immigrants-dont-flock-states-expand-215946669.html\n",
      " \" By Lisa Rapaport(Reuters Health) - States that expand public health benefits to cover low-income legal immigrants don't appear to experience a surge in immigrants moving to get medical coverage, a U.S. study suggests.Federal policy changes in 2002 and 2009 led some states to expand public health insurance coverage to some children born outside the U.S. and to certain pregnant women. For the study, researchers examined data on interstate moves between 2000 and 2016 for 208,060 immigrants who could qualify for health coverage in states that expanded public insurance.On average, 3% of the immigrants moved each year.The proportion of immigrants making interstate moves within the first five years of U.S. residency didn't appear to be influenced by expanded public health benefits, the study found.\\\"Our study showed that recent public health insurance expansion was not associated with a discernable increase in migration between states among eligible immigrants,\\\" senior study author Jens Hainmueller of Stanford University in California and colleagues write in JAMA Pediatrics.\\\"Despite immigrant families being more responsive to economic conditions and these health care programs having significant uptake, results suggest that states considering expansion of health care benefits to certain immigrant groups are unlikely to experience large increases in immigrants from other states,\\\" Hainmueller and colleagues write.In the U.S., one in four children under age 18 were either born outside the U.S. or have parents who are immigrants, researchers note.Federal welfare reform in 1996 for the most part barred legal immigrants who were permanent residents from getting public health benefits through Medicaid without five years of residency.A total of 18 states funded programs to cover immigrant children without five years of residency, and 16 states had prenatal care options for pregnant women who had not yet been legal residents for five years, researchers note.After a series of federal policy changes in 2002 and 2009, 31 states expanded public health benefits to children who were legal permanent residents and 32 states offered coverage to pregnant women - even when these people hadn't been legal residents for five years.In the year before certain states expanded coverage for immigrant children, the migration rate was 3.9%, the study found. In the year after coverage for these kids was added, the migration rate to these states was 3.7%.By comparison, in the year before this children's coverage expansion, the migration rate to expansion states was 4% for lawful permanent residents without kids, compared to 5.9% in the year after new benefits were added for kids.Over the year before certain states expanded coverage for pregnant women, meanwhile, migration rates to these states was 2.7%, compared with 4.6% the year afterward. Migration rates for lawful immigrants without kids was 3.5% in the year before the pregnancy coverage expansion and 3.9% in the year afterwards.The study wasn't a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how health policy changes might have directly impacted migration patterns for immigrants within the U.S.\\\"Immigrants do not uproot their lives and cross state borders to access health care, even at critical life moments, such as pregnancy and childhood development, and even if health care benefits across state lines are more comprehensive,\\\" Jonathan Miller of the Office of the Massachusetts Attorney General in Boston and Elora Mukherjee of the Immigrants' Rights Clinic at Columbia Law School in New York City write in an editorial accompanying the study.\\\"Making it easier for immigrant communities to connect to and seek care from physicians will not radically shift migration patterns,\\\" they write. \\\"Instead, allowing access to the basic human right of health care shows a common commitment to human decency for all who are in the United States.\\\"SOURCE: http://bit.ly/2rWnrSC JAMA Pediatrics, online November 18, 2019. \" \n",

Remington Arms, which manufactured and sold the semiautomatic rifle used in the attack, had hoped the broad immunity the industry has enjoyed for years would shield it from any liability.The prospect of more claims from victims of mass shootings puts new pressure on the gun industry to reconsider the way it does business.My research over the past 20 years on lawsuits against the gun industry examines how the threat of civil liability has the potential to promote safer gun designs, encourage more responsible marketing practice and reduce the risk of illegal retail sales.The end of ImmunityA 2006 law called the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act grants gun manufacturers broad immunity from civil lawsuits that arise out of the criminal misuse of a weapon.However, this immunity does not apply where a manufacturer “knowingly violated a state or federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing” of a firearm.The Sandy Hook families allege that Remington, by marketing certain guns to civilians, engaged in “unethical” business methods in violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act. Specifically, they argued Remington “marketed, advertised and promoted the Bushmaster XM15-E2S for civilians to use to carry out offensive, military-style combat missions against their perceived enemies.”Remington asked the court to throw out the lawsuit based on the federal immunity statute, but the Connecticut Supreme Court held that a violation of the state’s unfair trade practices law qualifies as an exception to the industry’s liability shield.Now that the U.S. Supreme Court has refused to hear Remington’s appeal, the case will move into discovery and, potentially, trial in a Connecticut state court.Since many states have unfair trade practices laws like Connecticut’s, gun violence victims are likely to bring similar claims elsewhere, effectively ending the gun industry’s federal immunity from civil lawsuits.Reducing Gun ViolenceIn other industries, the threat of civil liability has encouraged manufacturers to take steps in design, marketing and retail to reduce the risk of injuries associated with their products. Lawsuits have prompted automakers to develop safer car designs, vaping companies to end marketing aimed at teens and opioid manufacturers to take responsibility for oversupplying pills to irresponsible retailers.Similarly, exposing gun manufacturers to civil liability is likely to encourage them to consider reducing the lethality of their civilian weapons. The popularity of semiautomatic firearms increases the risk that gun violence incidents will cause multiple gunshot wounds to large numbers of victims. Companies may wish to limit their liability exposure by reducing the firepower of their products.Additionally, companies may wish to reconsider marketing campaigns that extol the combat characteristics of weapons they sell on the civilian market. Such campaigns are likely to give rise to more lawsuits alleging that such promotional tactics increase the risk that their guns will be the weapon of choice for mass shooters.Finally, lawsuits may encourage gun companies to work harder to teach retailers how to spot and prevent illegal straw purchases, in which a person buys a gun for someone else who is legally prohibited from purchasing it. The industry’s trade association – the National Shooting Sports Council – has long had a training and certification program for retailers to reduce the risk of illegal straw purchases. Beefing up that effort is another way to reduce the industry’s liability exposure.None of these actions would weaken the Second Amendment or undermine the commercial viability of the gun industry.Only the BeginningRegardless of whether the Sandy Hook families ultimately prevail, the U.S. Supreme Court’s refusal to hear an appeal in the case appears to have blown a giant hole in the gun industry’s immunity from civil litigation.However, this may not be the court’s last word on the subject. The justices might have another opportunity to review the case if the Sandy Hook plaintiffs win and the case works its way back up to the high court. The Supreme Court could then decide that the exception to federal immunity applies more narrowly.Moreover, there is no guarantee that other state courts will adopt the Connecticut Supreme Court’s interpretation of the immunity exception. Federal courts in New York and California have rejected similar lawsuits. Also, unfair trade practices laws in other states frequently limit lawsuits to product consumers, excluding claims by others injured by the products.In addition, gun violence victims face other challenges in winning their claims. They must convince judges and juries that routine industry marketing strategies constitute unfair trade practices and prove that those practices played a role in enabling criminal attacks. Prior to passage of federal immunity, no plaintiff ever won a lawsuit against a gun manufacturer for an injury arising out of criminal misuse of a weapon.Finally, litigation is not a panacea. Stemming the epidemic of gun violence in the U.S. will require a concerted effort by industry, government and organized citizen groups across the political spectrum.Lawsuits can help jump-start this process, but they are only the beginning.[ Expertise in your inbox.

      " \" Ricardo B. Brazziell/Austin American-Statesman via Associated PressThe mother of Texas death-row inmate Rodney Reed, who had his execution blocked over the weekend, voiced support for her son, saying: \\\"the truth will and shall set him free.\\\"Rodney Reed was granted a stay of execution on Friday. He has spent 20 years in prison for the 1996 murder of a 19-year-old woman named Stacey Stites.Reed's mother, Sandra Reed, told  CBS affiliate KEYE-TV on Saturday that she was \\\"so happy\\\" his execution had been blocked.\\\"We had witnesses that were intimidated, but now it's a new day. Twenty years or more have passed and things are changing, and I think this case will bring about a change,\\\" Sandra said. \\\"The truth will and shall set him free.\\\"The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals granted an indefinite stay of execution for Reed of Friday, hours after the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles recommended delaying the execution. His criminal conviction has not been overturned.The Innocence Project, Reed's legal team, filed an appeal on November 11 claiming the state had relied on false witness testimony. It also argues that new witness testimony could implicate Stite's then-fiance, ex-police officer Jimmy Fennell.In 2008, Fennell pleaded guilty to charges of kidnapping and improper sexual conduct with a person in custody. He was sentenced to ten years in prison. According to an affidavit from Arthur Snow, a fellow inmate and member of the Aryan Brotherhood, Fennell confessed to the killing while they served together. \\\"Jimmy said his fiancé had been sleeping around with a black man behind his back. By the way Jimmy spoke about this experience, I could tell that it deeply angered him,\\\" Snow said in the affidavit.\\\"Toward the end of the conversation Jimmy said confidently, 'I had to kill my N------loving fiancée.'\\\"Reed's brother, Rodrick Reed, and sister-in-law Wana Akpin, held a \\\"Free Rodney Reed\\\" rally on Sunday, and celebrities including Beyoncé, Kim Kardashian West, Meek Mill, and Oprah have voiced support for Reed.Kardashian West said on Instagram that she was with Reed when he learned his execution would be delayed.\\\"Words cannot describe the relief and hope that swept over the room in that moment,\\\" she said.She later told the \\\"Today\\\" show that it was an \\\"extremely emotional\\\" day.\\\"When someone has been through so much trauma and so much disappointment in their life that, especially when they feel like they haven't been heard, you can imagine still a sense of disbelief,\\\" she said, adding that Reed has a \\\"history of just being let down for so many years.\\\"NOW WATCH: Traditional Peruvian restaurant in NYC serves beef heart skewers \" \n",

      " \"  Two drug dealing teenagers have been jailed for life for the \\\"callous and casual\\\" murder of girl scout Jodie Chesney, who was stabbed to death in an east London park.County lines dealer Svenson Ong-a-Kwie, 19, and his 17-year-old apprentice, Arron Isaacs had been looking to take revenge on rivals when they killed Jodie by mistake, the Old Bailey heard.The popular 17-year-old student had been relaxing with friends in Amy's Park in Harold Hill, east London, on the evening of March 1 when two shadowy figures emerged from the dark and one knifed her in the back.She screamed and collapsed in the arms of her boyfriend, Eddie Coyle, 18, as her attackers made off in a fellow drug dealer's car.Days later, they were arrested together as they fled from the rear of a house connected with the youth.The defendants denied Jodie's murder, each blaming the other for inflicting the fatal wound.But prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC told jurors that both were responsible for the killing, amid incidents of \\\"casual violence\\\" in the drug-dealing world.The jury deliberated for less than six hours to find them guilty last week of Jodie's murder.Judge Wendy Joseph QC handed Ong-a-Kwie a life sentence with a minimum of 26 years.She sentenced Isaacs to be detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure for at least 18 years.She said that Jodie's death led to a \\\"world of anguish\\\" for her family, which came amid \\\"tit for tat\\\" incidents.Jodie was the victim of \\\"callous, casual and irresponsible violence\\\" which had shocked the community \\\"to the core\\\", she said.On the evidence, she found Ong-a-Kwie was the stabber and the 17-year-old his \\\"enthusiastic supporter\\\".Isaacs was initially shielded by anonymity, but now he can be named after the judge lifted reporting restrictions.In doing so, she said: \\\"What is important is that a blameless girl is dead at the hands of those engaged in and those that associate with drug dealing on the streets which Jodie and other blameless young people must live.\\\"This death has brought great unease in the community. Those suffering, which spreads much further than Jodie's friends and family, need and have a right to known and understand how this has come about.\\\"The judge lamented the impact of criminals that had \\\"carved up areas of the capital of this country\\\".She added: \\\"The dangers this brings to decent law-abiding members of the public is graphically spelled out in this case.\\\"The court heard moving tributes to Jodie and the \\\"ripple effect\\\" her murder had among friends, family and the wider community.Mr Coyle has been left with post-traumatic stress from witnessing her murder.He said: \\\"Jodie was funny, silly, she always made fun of me and she had a bright future ahead of her. She was full of energy and was always out doing something. We had been going out for three months.\\\"I've never lost anyone before and for the first funeral I've gone to to be my own girlfriend's is incredibly hard. I loved her.\\\"Jodie's father, Peter Chesney, who gave up a job in the City, said: \\\"I have lost the most precious human being I will ever know. I have no idea how I'm going to continue my life or come to terms with the loss.\\\"Her sister, Lucy, said: \\\"Jodie will be greatly missed and the people who caused such tragedy to a whole family should hang their head in shame. You have ripped away a bright future that was destined to make a change to many lives.\\\"The court heard that Ong-a-Kwie had convictions for possessing and supplying drugs.He admitted being in breach of a six-week suspended sentence for handling stolen jewellery dating back to October last year.Isaacs had previous convictions for possessing a screwdriver, actual bodily harm, possession of cannabis as well as aggravated vehicle-taking. \" \n",

      "https://news.yahoo.com/tiktok-reportedly-considering-rebrand-us-123139849.html\n",
      " \" Avishek Das/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty ImagesTikTok is brainstorming ways to distance itself from its Chinese roots, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.TikTok is exceptional as a Chinese social media company which has garnered huge success outside its domestic market, and broken Facebook's monopoly on social apps.But recently TikTok has attracted both press attention and political criticism. Reports have emerged of the company censoring content it fears may anger the Chinese government, and US lawmakers have characterized it as a potential national security threat. The Journal's report suggests that this increased scrutiny is worrisome enough for TikTok's leadership to consider scrubbing its image as a Chinese company.According to the Journal, TikTok employees have advised senior executives that the company could use a tactical rebrand to escape some of the recent scrutiny. It has already tried to blot out its Chinese roots at a user level by limiting the amount of China-made user content that appears on its app in the US, and in future the app's parent company ByteDance could decamp from Beijing to Singapore, sources also told the Journal.ByteDance already has something of a forked strategy with its apps. The homegrown version of TikTok is called Douyin and only available in China. TikTok is only available in non-Chinese markets.A ByteDance spokesman denied to the Journal that TikTok is considering a rebrand, that it is considering moving to Singapore, and that it screens out Chinese content in the US. He added that the company is not focused on an IPO.\\\"It is well known that ByteDance was founded in China. But the reality is that the TikTok app does not operate in China, and we are building out and empowering teams in the markets where it does operate. We have been very open about this,\\\" a ByteDance spokesman told Business Insider.The Journal added that there is additional pressure from ByteDance's investors, SoftBank and Sequoia, who see a US expansion as vital to the firm's financial growth.Despite its reported plans to distance itself from China's influence, it appears TikTok is still having to toe the line from Beijing, as one source told the Journal that when instructed the platform runs government ads free of charge.Do you work at TikTok?

      "https://news.yahoo.com/colombia-church-massacre-victims-id-220609555.html\n",
      " \" BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Relatives of those killed in a Colombia massacre put their loved ones to rest Monday nearly two decades after the attack – while also warning that the government hasn’t done enough to prevent a similar tragedy from happening again.Family members held a memorial ceremony in the Chocó province town of Bojayá following a painstaking process in which forensic scientists used DNA to identify nearly 80 people initially buried in mass graves.Relatives were handed small coffins holding the remains for burial.Rev. Esterling Mena told family members the new burial is important because it means those killed will no longer be interred in a place “chosen by war.”“They are returning to the ground on which they were raised,” he said.People were sheltering in a church as leftist rebels clashed with paramilitaries in 2002, and a mortar shell exploded inside, killing dozens.Despite a 2016 peace accord with the former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, victim advocates said illegal armed groups are still threatening residents of the town today.“The Havana accords gave us a ray of hope,” said Yuber Palacio, reciting a letter written by the Bojayá victims group. “It was a false illusion.”The Committee for the Rights of the Bojayá Victims warned that new criminal groups are taking control of territories once controlled by rebels and where Colombia’s government has little presence, leading to continued forced displacements, homicides and disappearances.“In recent months, fear has returned,” the group said in a seven-page letter. “Today, before our deceased adults and children who are guiding us from heaven, we tell the armed groups that we don’t want them in our territory.”Forensic scientists exhumed victim remains in 2017 that had been buried haphazardly in the turbulent aftermath of the attack.Claudia Adriana García, the head of Colombia’s forensic services office, said scientists worked closely with families to explain how each person was identified in hopes of providing closure that the initial mass burial did not.“As victims they thought the Colombian state had not done a proper handover,” she said.In all, forensic workers were able to identify 72 people using conventional genetic analysis and six more with new, more advanced techniques. Authorities count still unidentified miscellaneous remains as the 79th case.“Burying once is painful,” the victim organization said in its statement. “Exhuming and burying again tears apart the soul.”Alberto Brunori, Colombia representative for the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, said it was urgent for authorities to respond to the community’s warning cry while praising their support for peace.“Bojayá and the resilience of victims is an example for Colombia and the world,” he said. \" \n",

      "https://news.yahoo.com/john-oliver-says-want-irritate-083852572.html\n",
      " \" For the final episode of Last Week Tonight of the year, John Oliver turns his attention to the census. “[It’s] the only reason to open the door for a stranger, unless he tells you he has candy in his van,“ Oliver says, asking: “What if he has fudge?”The concept of the census is simple — a comprehensive count of every single person living in the United States, to plan for things like roads, schools, and emergency services. However, counting every single person is even harder than it might seem, which is why typically the government opens 250 regional offices and hires millions of temporary workers in order to reach out to 140 million households.Adding to the difficulty is that, according to Oliver, nobody likes filling out surveys — and when the government asks questions, people get suspicious. Census data helps determine Congressional representation and used as a basis to distribute federal funds and businesses use census data to decide where to open new branches. The census was considered so critical to the founding fathers that it’s the sixth sentence in the U.S. Constitution.“Freedom of speech didn’t even make it in there at all,” Oliver notes. “They had to tack that on with the 18th century equivalent of a Post-It Note.”Despite that important function, Congress has reportedly underfunded the census and, according to Oliver, the 2020 census is shaping up to be more complicated than usual due to budget shortfalls and active Republican meddling, including attempting to add a citizenship question that alienated many people. While the question of citizenship will not be on the census, per Oliver, the damage may already be done and experts worry that an undercount is inevitable. So Oliver decided to help spread the word that filling out the census is a good way to help your community and yourself.If that isn’t enough to get people interested in filling out the census survey, Oliver has one more idea sure to appeal to his audience: Filling out the census would probably really irritate Donald Trump. “This administration clearly thinks that some people don’t count,” Oliver says. “So there’s no better way to get back at [Trump] than to make sure that you do and make sure the census counts you.” \" \n",

      " \" Washington (AFP) - The United States announced Monday it would halt sanctions waivers for Iran's Fordow plant, ending a key part of a landmark nuclear deal after Tehran said it had resumed enrichment activities.The move is intended to end Russian and European cooperation with Iran on the once-secret site, which was supposed to become a civilian research center under the 2015 agreement.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pointed to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's announcement of renewed activity at Fordow -- a series of steps taken by Tehran as it presses European allies to make good on sanctions relief promised for compliance.\\\"Therefore the United States will terminate the sanctions waiver related to the nuclear facility at Fordow effective December 15, 2019,\\\" Pompeo told a news conference.\\\"The right amount of uranium enrichment for the world's largest state sponsor of terror is zero,\\\" Pompeo said.\\\"There is no legitimate reason for Iran to resume enrichment at this previously clandestine site. Iran should reverse its activity there immediately,\\\" he said.President Donald Trump last year withdrew from the denuclearization accord and reimposed sweeping sanctions on Iran, aiming to impose economic pain and reduce the Shiite clerical regime's influence in Arab countries.But the Trump administration has still granted waivers to let other nations implement the nuclear deal, which was negotiated under former president Barack Obama, without facing penalties in the United States.Critics of Trump have said that the waivers prove that the administration sees the benefits of the deal, while hawkish Republicans have been pressing on Pompeo to end them.Iran said that engineers at Fordow, an underground plant south at Tehran, began feeding uranium hexafluoride gas into mothballed enrichment centrifuges.Britain, France, Germany and the European Union said Iran's decision was \\\"inconsistent\\\" with the nuclear deal.The latest US step comes as Iran is rocked by violent protests sparked by the sudden decision to hike gas prices.Pompeo again voiced solidarity with the protesters.\\\"The world's watching,\\\" he said.\\\"The Iranian people will enjoy a better future when their government begins to respect basic human rights, abandons its revolutionary posture and its destabilizing foreign policy in the region, and behaves simply like a normal nation,\\\" he said. \" \n",

I feel very tired,\\\" said Thomas, 20, a student at another university who has been on the campus since the siege began. \\\"I didn’t throw Molotovs. I was here to support the protest. I don’t see anything wrong with it so I wanted to support the students.\\\"He then walked slowly, with about 10 others, towards the police who bodysearched and arrested him. He had the phone numbers of lawyers written on his right forearm.Police have made about 1,100 arrests in the past 24 hours on charges including rioting and possession of offensive weapons, they said. The total since June is more than 5,000.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said she hoped the standoff could be resolved and she had told police to handle it humanely.Lam spoke shortly after the Chinese-ruled city's new police chief urged the support of all citizens to end more than five months of unrest triggered by fears that China's central government is stifling the former British colony's special autonomy and freedoms, including its independent judiciary.Hundreds of them fled from the university or surrendered overnight and on Monday amid running battles on nearby streets where protesters threw petrol bombs and rocks at police.Some made it out by rope and motorcycle.\\\"Some rioters were seen escaping by abseiling off a footbridge to getaway vehicles below,\\\" police said in a statement. \\\"Our officers gave chase and were able to interrupt 37 of them including the drivers.\\\"About a dozen tried and failed to flee through the university's sewers. A Reuters witness saw them lower themselves into a tunnel wearing gas masks and plastic sheets, but the tunnel was too narrow.Six protesters, led by a male in full black body armour wielding a hammer, probed one of the exits on Tuesday, before deciding there were too many police around.\\\"We will keep trying,\\\" one of the group, dressed all in black, said without giving his name. \\\"It’s better than staying here.”On the sprawling campus in the Kowloon district, despair prevailed amid the shriek of fire alarms.\\\"I feel I'm in trouble,\\\" said a 22-year-old who gave his name as Marcus, sitting with two friends in the canteen at a table piled with dirty dishes and plastic cups.\\\"We keep trying to think how to escape, but every time we pick a spot we see many police nearby,\\\" Marcus said.\\\"But if we give up, we're finished.\\\"CHINA QUESTIONS COURT RULINGIn the campus central square, a giant \\\"SOS\\\" call for help was spelled out in pink, blue and yellow bath towels.The university is the last of five that protesters occupied to use as bases from which to disrupt the city, blocking the Cross-Harbour Tunnel outside and other main roads.In what many will see as an illustration of Beijing's tightening grip, China's legislature questioned the legality of a Monday Hong Kong court ruling that a ban on face masks worn by protesters was unlawful.The National People's Congress (NPC) said Hong Kong courts had no power to rule on the constitutionality of city legislation, the official Xinhua news agency reported.Lam said her government was very much on the \\\"reactive side\\\" in dealing with the protests but she did not rule out more violence even as she urged peace. Lam said she had been shocked that campuses had been turned into \\\"weapons factories\\\".Lam said 600 protesters had left the campus, including 200 below the age of 18.Many protesters say they fear more bloodshed in a standoff that has seen some of the most intense violence in the worst crisis since Hong Kong's return from British to Chinese rule in 1997.The U.N. human rights office said some demonstrators' resorting to extreme violence, including against police, was \\\"deeply regrettable and cannot be condoned\\\".One woman said her son was inside the campus with his girlfriend and they would come out but for the fear of facing charges of rioting, which can carry a 10-year sentence.\\\"I know the young people see there are many unrighteous things in society, they want to do something to change it,\\\" said the woman, who gave her name as Chan, 50.\\\"But as parents, we only have one wish. We only want all of them to come home safely.\\\"Protesters were initially angered by a now-withdrawn bill that could have sent people to mainland China for trial. Their campaign has broadened into calls for full democracy and an end to what many see as meddling by Beijing in China's freest city.China says it is committed to the \\\"one country, two systems\\\" formula, under which Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule, and has accused foreign countries of inciting trouble.The unrest poses the gravest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.

      "How To Turn China&#39;s A2/AD Strategy Back on Them\n",
      "https://news.yahoo.com/turn-chinas-a2-ad-strategy-000000453.html\n",
      " \" Key Point: Access is an important and too often forgotten part of military strategy. Last week the Pentagon released two appraisals of China in swift succession. The first, issued by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), goes by the title China Military Power and is patterned on the old-school Soviet Military Power tomes beloved by those of us of a vintage to have battled godless communism during the 1980s.People’s Liberation Army (PLA) specialists will find little new or eye-popping in China’s Military Power, but it does make a worthy refresher for oldtimers and primer for newcomers to the field. Read the whole thing.If the DIA report gauges Chinese power, the second Pentagon document, awkwardly titled “Assessment on U.S. Defense Implications of China’s Expanding Global Access,” explores the purposes for which Beijing harnesses power. It evaluates Chinese “grand strategy,” in other words, even though the phrase never appears in the document.This one’s worth your time as well. And it’s short!English soldier-scribe B. H. Liddell coined the phrase “grand strategy” in his masterwork Strategy (1954). In Liddell Hart’s telling, grand strategy is the art and science of choreographing the use of diplomatic, economic, cultural, and military implements of power to improve the “state of peace” for one’s country—preferably without resort to arms. Grand strategists take the long view from thirty thousand feet.The framers of “China’s Global Access” are right to accent the word “access.” They deploy it dozens of times. Chinese grand strategy is indeed a strategy premised on negotiating or wresting open access to distant seas and shores. Like other trading nations, China depends on waterborne transport to move bulk goods hither and yon. Its merchant fleet needs ready admission to harbors overseas to unload cargo for sale or load raw materials to carry back home.Hence the nautical tinge Chinese strategy has taken on in recent decades. After all, maritime strategy is the saltwater variety of grand strategy.For Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan, one of the godfathers of Chinese maritime strategy, access is both the goal of and the prime mover driving any maritime strategy worth the name. America’s sea-power evangelist contends that commercial, political, and military access to important trading regions—in that order of importance—constitutes the aim of maritime strategy.Commerce is king for Mahan. Seafaring governments seek diplomatic access to facilitate commercial access, while military access is necessary to facilitate diplomatic and thence commercial access. Access sets a cycle in motion. Domestic manufacturers sell goods overseas, paying tariffs and thus generating revenue adequate to fund a navy. The navy safeguards those goods during seaborne transit or closes the sea lanes to hostile powers.Grand strategy relating to the sea involves starting and perpetuating this virtuous cycle among industrial, diplomatic, and military enterprises. Beijing knows this in its marrow.Access came easy to Mahan’s America by contrast with China. Then as now, political geography exempted the United States from domineering neighbors able to menace its access from Atlantic and Pacific seaports to the high seas. Geography cursed China where it blessed America. Beijing must fret about access from the time a ship casts off lines in Shanghai or Tianjin until it moors at the far end of its voyage.Why? Because to exit the China seas or return from faraway ports of call, vessels must cross through the “first island chain,” a string of islands undulating from southern Japan through Taiwan, the Philippine Islands, and the Indonesian archipelago. The island chain plays host to powerful U.S. naval and air forces. Its occupants are allies or friends of the United States—meaning they are potential foes of China.In other words, shipping and aircraft on which China’s economic and geopolitical fortunes depend must pass under the shadow of hostile armed forces whenever they leave or return home. Strategic geography encumbers China’s ambitions to a degree unique among great powers.Small wonder Chinese strategists from PLA Navy founding father Admiral Liu Huaqing onward have dubbed the first island chain a “metal chain” that China must burst to fulfill its destiny—its “China Dream,” as President Xi Jinping likes to call it. Fracturing the island chain—by seizing part of it, such as Taiwan, or by wooing U.S. allies away from Washington’s embrace through diplomacy—is crucial to strategic success.Access begets success. This Mahanian idea courses through “China’s Global Access” even though the Pentagon authors do not couch their reportage in grand-strategic parlance.Historians of colonialism often ask whether the flag followed trade or trade followed the flag for some empire or another. Did mercantile interests obtain access to new trading regions, requiring diplomatic and military protection—the “flag”—or did diplomats and military folk lay a beachhead, making it safe for commerce to follow?Mahan seems to envisage doing it all at once. He exhorted the United States to build up industry and commerce, lay down merchant and naval fleets, and seek access to distant seaports. He likened commerce, ships, and bases to three “links” in a sea-power “chain.” And he wanted to cast all three links at the same time.Deliberately or not, the report’s authors intimate that China has departed from strict adherence to the Mahanian script. Beijing is pursuing diplomacy and economic statecraft to gain access to the wider world, but military access tends to trail behind these efforts. For instance, the PLA Navy has maintained a squadron in the Gulf of Aden for a decade and put in appearances elsewhere. Apart from the western Indian Ocean, though, China’s navy has yet to establish a standing presence outside home waters.Nonmilitary tools represent the vanguard of Chinese grand strategy outside East Asia—for now.This pattern is probably another product of geography. China can accomplish little in “far seas” such as the Indian Ocean or Mediterranean Sea unless its merchant or naval fleets can get there from the “near seas” washing against mainland shores. Thus far-seas endeavors refocus strategists and practitioners on guaranteeing access from the China seas to the Western Pacific.Now as in the lifetime of Admiral Liu, the contest for access starts at home.Intriguingly, though, “China’s Global Access” doesn’t depict the U.S. strategic response as a quest to assure and deny access. But it should, shouldn’t it? Commercial, political, and military access to the Eurasian rimlands has been central to U.S. grand strategy since the days of Mahan—as indeed Mahan said it should be.That access is now in peril as China, Russia, and other coastal competitors festoon their shorelines with “anti-access” and “area-denial” weaponry reputedly able to hold U.S. naval forces at a distance. America has no meaningful strategic position in the Far East without access to bases in Japan and elsewhere along the island chain.You’d think the imperative to preserve access would rank uppermost in American military minds.Meanwhile the Pentagon should fashion access- and area-denial strategies of its own. PLA and Chinese Communist Party thinkers and practitioners obsess over maritime access for a reason: access deniers along the island chain could cut China off from the trading world.To channel Mahan, sealing the straits permitting passage through the island chain would be like cutting the roots of a plant. It would deny the Chinese merchant fleet and PLA Navy access to the oceanic thoroughfare on which they rely to ply their trades. China’s import and export traffic—crucial to its prosperity, and thus to fulfilling the China Dream—could shrivel and die.Its geopolitical standing could wilt in the process.A U.S. access-denial strategy, then, would impose a hard fate on China. Which is the point. Threatening fearful consequences could deter Beijing from aggression tomorrow morning, and the next. If Xi Jinping & Co. wake up and choose forbearance enough days in a row, who knows? China, Asia, and the world could learn to coexist over time.Lions need not lie down with lambs. Uneasy peace will do. Rediscovering the pivotal role of access will illumine the way.James Holmes is J. C.

      "https://news.yahoo.com/christine-blasey-ford-makes-rare-131353959.html\n",
      " \" Christine Blasey Ford, who accused supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, made a rare public appearance on Sunday night.“When I came forward last September,” she said, accepting an award from the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California in Beverly Hills, “I did not feel courageous. I was simply doing my duty as a citizen.”“I understood that not everyone would welcome my information, and I was prepared for a variety of outcomes, including being dismissed.”Blasey Ford, a professor of psychology at Palo Alto University in California, came forward in September 2018, as Kavanaugh’s nomination was before the Senate.In testimony before the Senate judiciary committee, she alleged that he assaulted her at a party in suburban Maryland in 1982, pinning her down, groping her, trying to remove her clothing and putting his hand over her mouth when she screamed.Kavanaugh angrily denied the allegation – and similar claims against him – and was confirmed as Donald Trump’s second supreme court pick.His ascent, after that of Neil Gorsuch, tipped the ideological balance of the highest court in favour of conservative justices.Kavanaugh also appeared in public last week, addressing an event on Friday in Washington and staged by the Federalist Society, the rightwing group which has played an influential role in Trump’s supreme court picks.“I signed up for what I knew would be an ugly process,” he said. But he said he had expected his confirmation to be “maybe not that ugly”.Kavanaugh was confirmed by just two votes, the narrowest margin for a supreme court justice since 1881.His appearance at Union Station in Washington was greeted by protests, including women dressed up as characters from The Handmaid’s Tale television series.Last year, lawyers for Ford said her life had been “turned upside down” and she had effectively gone into hiding, such was the vitriol directed her way after her testimony in the Senate.Related: New York Times editor says Trump has put his reporters’ lives at riskFord “received a stunning amount of support from her community and from fellow citizens across our country”, the lawyers said in a letter to Senate judiciary committee chairman, Chuck Grassley.“At the same time, however, her worst fears have materialized. She has been the target of vicious harassment and even death threats. As a result of these kind of threats, her family was forced to relocate out of their home. Her email has been hacked, and she has been impersonated online.”At the Beverly Hills event on Sunday, Blasey Ford accepted the Roger Baldwin Courage Award, named for the founder of the ACLU. When coming forward, she said, she had “simply thought that it was my duty as a citizen and that anyone in my position would do the same thing”. \" \n",

      "https://news.yahoo.com/paul-erickson-russian-agent-maria-230655932.html\n",
      " \" Paul Erickson, the former boyfriend of convicted Russian agent Maria Butina, has pleaded guilty to wire fraud and money laundering, according to a plea agreement filed in a South Dakota federal court Monday afternoon.In a two-page statement detailing the factual basis for the plea, Erickson said he conned someone only identified as “D.G.” into wiring him $100,000 under the pretense that the money was for a real estate investment in North Dakota. As part of the plea filed in U.S. district court in South Dakota, Erickson admits the money was not for a real estate deal. He also notes that he wired $1,000 of the money to a person called “M.B.” An attorney for Erickson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The case against Erickson, a well-known conservative operative who shuttled between Washington D.C. and South Dakota, was separate from the one lodged against Butina in Washington, D.C.Butina, a Russian national who cultivated relationships with powerful American conservative activists including Erickson, pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate laws prohibiting covert foreign agents. As part of her agreement she has promised to cooperate with American law enforcement. She was deported earlier this year after serving a short prison sentence to her native Russia where she received a hero’s welcome.Paul Erickson, Russian Agent Maria Butina’s Boyfriend, Indicted for FraudErickson became involved in relationship with Butina in 2013. As The Daily Beast previously reported, the duo dressed up as Rasputin to Butina’s flame-haired Empress Alexandra during a 2016 birthday party. The over-the-top gathering included an ice sculpture of a bottle imprinted with the Soviet hammer and sickle from which vodka flowed.The couple, who at one point lived together in South Dakota, had some kind of business together. The two were listed as the sole officers of Bridges LLC, a company registered in the state in February 2016, though it’s unclear what the company did or how it operated.Erickson was indicted in February on allegations that he ran a criminal scheme from 1996 to 2018 in which he was accused of using a chain of assisted living homes called Compass Care. Prosecutors alleged that Erickson also defrauded investors through a company called Investing with Dignity that claimed to be “in the business of developing a wheelchair that allowed people to go to the bathroom without being lifted out of the wheelchair.” The indictment says he also ran a fraudulent scheme that claimed to be building homes in the Bakken oil fields of North Dakota.Maria Butina’s Beau Snookered Investors With a Shady Oil DealAs first reported by The Daily Beast in July, several people have sued Erickson in California, Virginia, and South Dakota, claiming he misrepresented himself and his businesses and failed to pay investors back.The Daily Beast was first to unveil Erickson’s business scheme in North Dakota where he knowingly misled investors about owning a company there, according to a 2015 judgement filed in a California court.Two individuals who Erickson approached told The Daily Beast that he swindled them into investing in a land deal he had set up near Williston, North Dakota. Erickson told the two that he owned land there and would set up a transaction between two of his companies.One of the companies he represented while soliciting investments was Northern Plains Holdings, LLC, according to investors and people familiar with the deal.The North Dakota secretary of state’s office told The Daily Beast it did not have record of such a company connected to Erickson. In a complaint filed in a lawsuit in 2015, one of the investors alleged Erickson planned to use a company he controlled to sell undeveloped North Dakota land it owned to a second company Erickson controlled.In an email in November of 2013 to a potential investor for the Bakken deal, Erickson asked for funding for what he called his “new real estate development venture” in North Dakota.“I’m extremely proud of the work of our development team as together we find new ways to service the office and housing needs of this new American gold rush,” Erickson wrote.In the email, Erickson called his new business the “Bakken oil fields” and said it was set up to capitalize on the boom in North Dakota.“Due to your interest in my work and in consideration of past kindness, I would welcome your investment of any amount you choose (up to $100,000),” the email said.Erickson garnered at least $50,000 from the email exchange and did not pay any of it back, according to the judge’s decision on the 2015 case.— Pervaiz Shallwani contributed to this story.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

      "https://news.yahoo.com/bangladesh-organises-onion-airlift-prices-133051119.html\n",
      " \"  South Asia's onion crisis has widened, with Bangladesh airlifting supplies of the vegetable and the prime minister claiming prices are so high she has stopped eating them.The spike in Bangladesh has put a staple ingredient for much South Asian food out of reach of the country's poor and follows a similar price hike in India.Prices in Bangladesh rocketed after India banned exports to conserve its own stocks after they were hit first by drought and then by heavy monsoon rains.As prices reached record levels, Bangladesh’s largest opposition party blamed the government for the hike and on Monday called for nationwide protests.The humble bulb is so important to daily cooking in South Asia that shortages have a history of political fallout and a reputation for even toppling governments.One kilo of the vegetable in Bangladesh usually costs 30 taka (27p) but soared to up to 260 taka (£2.37) after India's export ban was imposed.India has seen its own spike in prices after a sharp fall in production and the issue has become a political headache for Delhi. India has already released its national buffer stocks and imposed measures to stop onion hoarding.Hasan Jahid Tusher, deputy press secretary for Bangladesh's prime minister Sheikh Hasina, told AFP onions were being imported by air freight, and that “prime minister said she has stopped using onion in dishes”.None of the dishes at the PM’s residence in Dhaka on Saturday contained onions, he added.Media in Bangladesh reported onion consignments arrived at a major port in Chittagong city on Sunday after the government imported stocks from Myanmar, Turkey, China and Egypt.The increasing prices have pushed onions off restaurant and domestic menus, with Bangladeshis having to adjust their cooking and tastebuds.“Onion has become an essential part of the taste buds of the people of this region, including Bangladesh,” a restaurateur called Shafiqul Islam told bdnews24. “A food can be eatable, but not much delicious without onion. Onion is a must for fish and meat recipes, biriyani and many other dishes.”The state run Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB) has attracted long queues waiting for subsidised onions.“Even if I have to stand another two hours, I will do that. I can save some 250 taka by buying one kilo of TCB onion. I am standing here because I have to save money,” said Ratan, an English teacher.“I am 41 years old. I have never seen onion prices ever crossing beyond 120 taka.”Drought badly hit India's first onion harvest in the spring, while unusually heavy monsoon rains hit the second harvest. The fluctuating price of onions is widely used as an everyday measure of inflation and a sudden inability for the poor to buy them can quickly focus concern over wider economic problems.Indira Ghandi came to power in 1980 citing soaring onion prices as a metaphor for economic failures of the government. The issue dominated state elections in 1998 and again became a political crisis in 2010.India last week said it was importing 100,000 tons of onions in a bid to curb rising prices.Pakistan has meanwhile seen its own vegetable inflation, with a spike in tomato prices. A government finance adviser came in for widespread mockery after he insisted tomatoes were to be found for 17 rupees (8p) per kg. The price is more than 10 times that. \" \n",

      "https://news.yahoo.com/pennsylvania-agrees-upgrade-inmates-death-153300565.html\n",
      " \" HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Pennsylvania’s prison agency agreed to improve death row conditions under a settlement announced Monday of a federal lawsuit that called the inmates’ living standards degrading and inhumane.Lawyers for the inmates who sued said the agreement provides people on death row with at least 42½ hours a week out of their cell, daily access to phones and contact visits with their families, lawyers and religious advisers.A Wolf administration spokesman confirmed the settlement and said many of the agreement’s changes have already been adopted.“They now eat their meals on the unit with others from their housing units, and they are able to exercise with other inmates,” said Corrections Department spokeswoman Sue McNaughton.The deal also limits the use of strip searches, shackling and other restraints unless temporarily needed.Death row inmates who have been psychologically damaged by long periods in solitary confinement will be evaluated and offered help adapting to a general population setting.Death row conditions have prompted litigation in recent years in many states, usually focusing on the use of solitary confinement, said Death Penalty Information Center executive director Robert Dunham.“We have learned over time how damaging solitary confinement can be. And it is damaging not just to the mental state of the prisoner but to corrections officials as well,” Dunham said.The state will continue to house inmates who were sentenced to death in two facilities, the Phoenix and Greene state prisons.The federal lawsuit filed nearly two years ago sought an end to mandatory, indefinite solitary confinement for the 136 men currently on death row in the state.“The use of long-term solitary confinement on anyone is torture,” Amy Fettig, deputy director of the National Prison Project, said in a release.The lawsuit said death row inmates were spending 22 to 24 hours a day locked up alone, in small cells that were illuminated at all hours.They could exercise in small, outdoor enclosures for no more than two hours during weekdays but were confined to their cells on weekends, unless they had visitors. They changed cells every three months.Pennsylvania has executed three people since 1976, all of whom voluntarily gave up on their appeals.The state's death row has been shrinking, as fewer death sentences are being imposed and appeals have resulted in some death row inmates being resentenced to life. The death row population has fallen by about 20 people over the last two years.Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf implemented a death penalty moratorium soon after taking office five years ago, citing concern about \\\"a flawed system that has been proven to be an endless cycle of court proceedings as well as ineffective, unjust, and expensive.\\\" \" \n",

      "https://news.yahoo.com/three-dead-oklahoma-walmart-shooting-including-gunman-192638446.html\n",
      " \" Washington (AFP) - Three people were killed in a shooting early Monday outside a Walmart store in Oklahoma, including the assailant, police said -- the latest in a string of deadly gun attacks at the popular supermarket chain.Danny Ford, the police chief in the town of Duncan, said the shooting -- an apparent domestic dispute -- took place shortly before 10:00 am (1600 GMT) in a parking lot in front of the store.\\\"We have three individuals that are deceased. We have two white males and a white female. Two of the victims are inside the vehicle, one is outside the vehicle,\\\" said Ford.A handgun was also found at the scene, police said.Witnesses told local news channels that the shooter approached his victims while they were inside the vehicle, opening fire on them.He then turned his weapon on himself when a fourth man reportedly pulled out a firearm and challenged the shooter, they said.Family members at the scene said the shooting was a domestic dispute between a husband and his wife, a local Fox news affiliate reported.A Walmart spokeswoman told Fox that no staff members were involved in the incident in Duncan, a town of 22,000 inhabitants some 75 miles (120 kilometers) south of Oklahoma City, the state capital.Schools in the area had been placed on lockdown temporarily before being given an \\\"all clear\\\" by local police, the local school district said in a statement.At the start of this month, a new permitless carry law came into effect in the central US state, allowing anyone over 21 and without a felony conviction to carry a gun without a permit or a license.A gunman killed 22 people in a Walmart store in August in El Paso, Texas, while another Walmart store in Mississippi was the scene of a shooting in late July, when a disgruntled employee killed two co-workers and wounded a police officer.In the El Paso shooting, the 21-year-old gunman said he had launched the deadly attack in response to what he called a \\\"Hispanic invasion\\\" of Texas.Walmart said in the wake of the two shootings inside its stores within a week of each other that it would limit sales of guns and ammunition. \" \n",

Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council expert on Ukraine, is scheduled to testify Tuesday about his concerns with President Donald Trump's call with his Ukrainian counterpart in the House impeachment inquiry.Vindman, who listened to the July 25 call, reported his concerns to NSC lawyers because Trump asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.“I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government’s support of Ukraine,” Vindman told lawmakers in his closed-door deposition. \\\"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see where the gain would be for the president in investigating the son of a political opponent.\\\"Trump slammed Vindman on Twitter as a “Never Trumper” and urged him to read a transcript of the call. The call occurred during a suspension in providing U.S. military aid to Ukraine, but Trump insisted in another tweet that he didn’t demand the investigation in exchange for the funding.Asked on Nov. 3 for evidence that Vindman was a “Never Trumper,” the president replied: “You’ll be seeing very soon what comes out.”Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., sent a letter Monday to Defense Secretary Mark Esper urging him to notify all civilian and military personnel of their legal rights to make protected disclosures to Congress free from retaliation. Schumer said Vindman and Laura Cooper, a deputy assistant secretary of Defense, who is scheduled to testify Wednesday, have been attacked as traitors in the media.“Bravely, in the face of these shameful attacks, these individuals have still chosen to come forward and tell the truth despite the risk of professional reprisals and threats to their personal safety,” Schumer said. “I fear, however, these attacks will only increase after their participation in these public hearings.”Esper has said the Pentagon has protections for whistleblowers and Vindman “shouldn’t have any fear of retaliation.”The hearing begins at 9 a.m.Also on Tuesday morning, the committee will hear from Jennifer Williams, a National Security Council aide assigned from the State Department to the office of Vice President Mike Pence. She listened to the July 25 call and provided a memo about the call to Pence, although she couldn’t say whether he read it. She told lawmakers at her closed-door deposition that it was “folly” to withhold military aid to Ukraine and that the call was “unusual.”\\\"I would say that it struck me as unusual and inappropriate,\\\" Williams said when asked what her own personal reaction to the call was. Trump has also criticized Williams as a \\\"Never Trumper.\\\"On Tuesday afternoon, the panel will hear from Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, and Tim Morrison, a National Security Council senior director for Europe and Russia.Republicans had asked to hear from Volker and Morrison to compare their testimony to Vindman’s. Volker in his closed-door testimony described Trump's longstanding presumption of corruption in Ukraine. The special envoy also said \\\"no,\\\" when asked if Trump asked Ukraine to manufacture dirt on the Bidens, in contrast to looking for evidence of whether Burisma tried to influence the 2016 U.S. election. How to stay updated on USA TODAY's impeachment coverage How to stay updated on USA TODAY's impeachment coverage\\\"Even if he's asking them to investigate the Bidens, it is to find out what facts there may be rather than to manufacture something,\\\" Volker said.Republicans have argued that the dispute about the July 25 call amounts to policy disagreements, and that Trump has the authority to direct foreign policy.Morrison told lawmakers in his closed-door deposition that he asked National Security Council lawyers to review Trump’s July 25 call because he thought it “would be damaging” if it “leaked.”But Morrison also said the White House chief of staff’s office had informed the Office of Management and Budget that “it was the President’s direction to hold the assistance.”This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Impeachment hearing schedule: Alexander Vindman testifies on Trump \" \n",

      "https://news.yahoo.com/turkey-orders-detention-133-military-045729864.html\n",
      " \" ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey has ordered the detention of 133 military personnel over suspected links to a network Ankara accuses of organizing an attempted coup in 2016, the state-run Anadolu news agency said on Tuesday.The suspects are being sought in an operation centered in the western coastal province of Izmir, Anadolu said, adding that 82 of them were serving members in the military.Ankara blames U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999, of masterminding the failed putsch on July 15, 2016. He has denied any involvement.In the three-year purge since the coup attempt, more than 77,000 people have been jailed pending trial and about 150,000 civil servants, military personnel and others have been sacked or suspended from their jobs. Widespread arrests are still carried out routinely.Turkey's Western allies and rights groups have criticized the massive crackdown, saying President Tayyip Erdogan has used the abortive coup as a pretext to quash dissent.Ankara has defended the measures as a necessary response to the scale of the security threat facing Turkey, and has vowed to eradicate Gulen's network.(Reporting by Tuvan Gumrukcu; Editing by Shri Navaratnam) \" \n",

      "The Fighter Planes Iran Desperately Wants (This Picture Is a Clue)\n",
      "https://news.yahoo.com/fighter-planes-iran-desperately-wants-220000100.html\n",
      " \" Key Point: Sanctions would likely prevent any huge arms sales to Iran.The Iranian air force on paper is one of the biggest air arms in the world. Its order of battle includes around 350 fighters, more than twice as many as the Royal Air Force possesses.But most of Iran’s fighters are old and outdated. The ones that aren’t old are just new copies of old designs. The air force’s squadrons fly American-made F-14s, F-5s and F-4s dating from the 1970s, some 1980s-vintage MiG-29s and Sukhoi fighter-bombers and a few J-7s that the Islamic Republic bought from China during the 1990s.Iran’s only recent acquisitions are locally-made, reverse-engineered copies of the F-5. But the country repeatedly has tried to buy new fighters, if all the news reports and rumors are true. What follows is a list of fighters Iran reportedly wanted but couldn’t get.MiG-31:In 1990 Tehran placed an order from Moscow for, among other weapons, 24 MiG-31 interceptors. The twin-engine MiG-31 was the Soviet Union’s successor to the Mach-three MiG-25. MiG-31s significantly could have improved Iran’s ability to patrol its air space and threaten its neighbors.But the Soviet Union collapsed before it could fill Iran’s order. In 1992, Tehran tried again, ordering from a cash-hungry Russia a fresh batch of MiG-29s and well as Tu-22 bombers, MiG-27 fighter-bombers and 24 MiG-31s. This time around the United States successfully applied pressure on Russia to cancel the sale.The United States reportedly even offered to buy the MiG-31s from Russia at a higher price than Iran could afford.Nine years later in 2001, Tehran tried one more to acquire MiG-31s, and even paid for them in advance. Again, the United States leaned on Russia to cancel the contract.Su-27/Su-30:Reports abound of alleged Iranian attempts to acquire from Russia either Su-27 fighters or the more modern Su-30 version of the same plane. In 2007 rumors of a contract for a whopping 250 Su-30s compelled the head of Rosoboronexport, Russia’s arms-export agency, to formally deny that any such sale was in the works.Iran in 2016 reportedly tried again the acquire the Su-30, but this time U.N. sanctions -- part of the 2015 deal limiting Iran’s nuclear program -- complicated the effort.J-10:Iran in the 1990s succeeded in buying a few J-7s from China. The J-7 is China’s copy of the Russian MiG-21. In the past decade the Chinese air force has begun replacing many of its own J-7s with newer J-10s. The J-10 is a much more modern design. Its performance roughly matches that of the American F-16.In 2015 rumors circulated that Tehran wanted to acquire as many as 150 J-10s. But nothing came of the rumors. China, it’s worth noting, is a major trading partner with the Middle East’s Arab states such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, both bitter rivals of Persian Iran.For China, selling a few billions dollars worth of warplanes to Iran probably isn’t worth the diplomatic rift with Arab governments that could result.What Iran Does Instead: Barred from acquiring new fighters, Iran has resorted to upgrading and copying its older planes. F-4s, F-14s and Su-22s have received structural repairs and new sensors and weapons. Meanwhile, Iranian engineers have torn apart, studied and copied the simple, lightweight F-5 and produced at least two kinds of clone.The Saeqeh apparently mates the fuselage of an unflyable F-5 with new twin tail fins replacing the old, single fin. Iran reportedly has built nine Saeqehs since the type first appeared in 2004.In 2018 Iran revealed another F-5 clone, the two-seat Kowsar. Iranian state media claimed the Kowsar is 100-percent locally-made, but as with the Saeqeh it’s possible that Iran is basing the “new” fighter on old, stored F-5 airframes rather than building airframes from scratch.Frustrated for decades in its attempts to buy new fighters, Iran might have no choice but to endlessly upgrade old planes. But there are limits to what upgrades can achieve. An F-4 with a better radar is still an F-4: sluggish, hard-to-fly and decided non-stealthy.Likewise, a copy of an F-5 still performs just like an F-5 does and probably could not match the more modern warplanes that Iran’s rivals operate.David Axe serves as Defense Editor of the National Interest.

      "https://news.yahoo.com/china-confirms-aircraft-carrier-sailed-taiwan-strait-084229008.html\n",
      " \" China confirmed on Monday that its first domestically built aircraft carrier had sailed through the Taiwan Strait for \\\"routine\\\" training and tests after Taipei accused Beijing of intimidation around upcoming elections.The ship, which has yet to be named, is Beijing's second carrier and will add massive firepower to its navy once it is officially put into service, as the country faces tensions with self-ruled Taiwan and regional neighbours around the disputed South China Sea.The carrier crossed the sensitive waters on Sunday before entering the South China Sea for \\\"scientific research tests and routine training\\\", navy spokesman Cheng Dewei said on an official social media account.Cheng said it was \\\"normal practice\\\" for carriers that are under testing to conduct cross-regional trials.\\\"It is not aimed at any specific target and has nothing to do with the current situation,\\\" Cheng said without elaborating.The sail-by comes as Taiwan gears up for presidential elections in January.Foreign minister Joseph Wu tweeted on Sunday that China \\\"intends to intervene\\\" in Taiwan's elections\\\", adding: \\\"Voters won't be intimidated!\\\"Taiwan's defence ministry said it had dispatched ships and planes to track and closely monitor the carrier's movements, and that US and Japanese vessels trailed it in the strait.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Monday the naval operation was \\\"nothing to be surprised about\\\" and in line with international law.China, which sees democratic Taiwan as part of its territory, has stepped up military drills around the island since Beijing-sceptic President Tsai Ing-wen, who is seeking re-election, came to power in 2016.\\\"We are keeping abreast of the situation in the entire Taiwan Strait,\\\" Tsai told reporters on Monday.\\\"I believe that we are capable of defending ourselves and I ask our countrymen to rest assured.\\\"Tsai -- who has voiced support for Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement -- has described the elections as a fight for Taiwan's freedom and democracy.Her challenger favours much warmer relations with China.On the same day as the sail-by, Tsai announced that former premier William Lai, who has styled himself as a \\\"Taiwan independence worker\\\", would be her running mate in a move likely to irritate Beijing.- 'Undoubtedly deliberate' -Eric Hundman, assistant professor of political science at NYU Shanghai, said that the ship's crossing was a \\\"continuation of Beijing's consistent efforts to pressure Taipei\\\".\\\"The choice to sail through the Taiwan Strait was undoubtedly deliberate and probably intended as a signal to both Taiwan and the US of China's increasing naval capabilities,\\\" he said.The \\\"Type 001A\\\" carrier was launched in 2017 and sea trials began the following year. It is expected to be commissioned in 2020.State television on Monday broadcast images of the Type 001A with at least three fighter jets on its flight deck.The state-run Global Times cited an anonymous military expert as saying the ship likely sailed through the strait to dock at its possible home base in Sanya, a port in southern China's Hainan island.Hainan province is in the South China Sea east of Vietnam, which has competing claims in the waterway along with China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Brunei.\\\"Basing in Sanya would give the carrier a geographically advantageous staging point for operations into the Indian Ocean and, through Bashi Channel south of Taiwan, into the West Philippine Sea,\\\" Collin Koh, a research fellow at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, told AFP.China has one other carrier -- the Liaoning, a repurposed Soviet carrier bought from Ukraine that went into service in 2012.A US think-tank reported in May that recent satellite photographs indicated that construction of a third Chinese aircraft carrier was well under way.Adding a third aircraft carrier will put China in an elite club among naval powers but it will still lag far behind the United States, which has 10 nuclear-powered Nimitz-class \\\"supercarriers\\\" currently in service. \" \n",

      "https://news.yahoo.com/mexican-president-defends-indigenous-pensions-175727933.html\n",
      " \" MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s president on Monday defended a plan to provide pensions to indigenous people starting at age 65, compared with 68 for other Mexicans.Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who was elected last year after campaigning to help marginalized people, said those who question the idea should visit poor indigenous communities to see how residents live.He said indigenous seniors in poor areas are often in worse health than city-dwelling counterparts due to decades of hard labor and poor nutrition.“It is painful that a senior in the city, age 65, is better preserved than an indigenous person of 65 because they work, they eat poorly, they have to walk for kilometers and they suffer greatly,” López Obrador said. “How do we not give them special attention?”Some criticized his plan for considering race in the provision of social benefits.“Only a deeply racist government would parcel out a social program measuring aid according to people’s race,” tweeted Julen Rementeria, a senator representing the Gulf coast state of Veracruz for the conservative National Action Party.López Obrador said he regrets that targeting indigenous people for aid would be considered discriminatory.“If giving preferential attention to indigenous people is racist, put me on the list,” the president said.López Obrador explained that his plan would enshrine in the constitution the indigenous seniors’ right to receive pensions at age 65.He also envisions the right for poor children with disabilities to get government stipends and for poor students to receive scholarships under a constitutional reform that his government will send to lawmakers. \" \n",

      "Hong Kong Financial Elites Shun Local Schools as Protests Mount\n",
      "https://news.yahoo.com/hong-kong-financial-elites-shun-000000079.html\n",
      " \" (Bloomberg) -- At Hong Kong’s most prestigious local schools, the admissions process can be brutally competitive. Demand for openings almost always exceeds supply, and children from the city’s upper echelons often get rejected.But as pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong intensify, some financial professionals who once coveted such schools for their kids are now steering them away. With children as young as 11 getting arrested for participating in the protests, these parents -- a mix of Hong Kongers and mainland Chinese -- are worried that the city’s local system of government-run and subsidized schools has become far too politicized.“We wanted our kid to focus on his education instead of becoming political,” said Janey Cheng, 34, who works in the insurance industry and recently scrapped plans to get her son into a highly competitive local school. She sent him to a private international one instead.Interviews with other Hong Kong parents and education consultants suggest Cheng has plenty of company. ITS Educational Services Ltd., which helps families apply to schools, has seen a 30% surge in inquiries and applications to Hong Kong international schools and overseas boarding schools over the past year. At least a dozen families from mainland China who had planned to educate their children in Hong Kong are now looking at boarding schools in Thailand and Singapore, said Anne Murphy, an ITS director.Hong Kong’s schoolkids have played a major role in the city’s pro-democracy movement, winning praise from supporters who applaud their civic engagement at an unusually young age. But as the protests grow more violent and rhetoric on both sides of the political divide turns more extreme, an increasing number of parents are taking steps to insulate their children.While Hong Kong offers a wide variety of education options, the city’s schools can be broadly divided into two categories: local and international.Local schools include those run by Hong Kong’s government as well as some private institutions that offer a government-recommended curriculum. Many of the teachers are from Hong Kong and classes are at least partially conducted in Cantonese.International schools tend to follow an international baccalaureate curriculum or are modeled after overseas education systems like those of Britain and America. They usually have a higher proportion of expat students and teachers and are generally viewed as less influenced by local politics. They’re also a lot more expensive: the annual fee for primary-aged students at the prestigious Chinese International School exceeds HK$200,000 ($25,500).Parents cite varied reasons for growing wary of the local system. For some, particularly those from mainland China, the worry is that their kids will be pressured by peers and teachers to join the protests and risk being ostracized if they don’t.“I’ve seen kids holding up signs against the police, but they are too young to understand politics,” said Li, a 36-year-old insurance broker who is among the roughly 1 million people who’ve moved to Hong Kong from mainland China over the past two decades. She’s applying to eight international schools for her 4-year-old son next year.“I fear that the local teachers would spread ideas to the young children with their own prejudice,” said Li, who asked that her full name not be used because the topic is sensitive.School administrators have been trying to prevent political tensions from spilling into their classrooms, but they haven’t always been successful, said Chiu Cheung Ki, chairman of the Hong Kong Direct Subsidy Scheme Schools Council.The city’s education bureau disclosed last month that it received 58 complaints between mid-June and mid-September about teacher conduct related to the protests. It said two cases were substantiated, five weren’t, and the rest were under investigation.Students at local schools have organized strikes, sit-ins and human chains on campuses, and in some cases have risked their lives in front-line clashes with police. Of the 3,440 protest-linked arrests between June 9 and Nov. 7, police data show that 208 -- or 6% -- involved children under 16. Last month, an 18-year-old student was shot near the chest and a 14-year-old took a bullet in the thigh.“They learn from online forums about how to negotiate with teachers and schools for permission to go on strike and also how to influence their classmates,” said John Tang, who teaches at a local secondary school where kids between 16 and 17 are the most active protest participants. “Students who don’t agree with this kind of behavior don’t talk about it, because it’s almost impossible to have discussions these days. The more radical students will shout and scold you if they can’t win over a debate.”To many observers, the students’ political engagement is impressive. “These young people, especially many of those in secondary schools, they are doing very well in their exams and they can have bright futures to go to good universities and become doctors or lawyers and yet they are putting themselves out there,” said Joseph Cheng, a professor at the City University of Hong Kong and a pro-democracy activist.Thomas Chang, 34, who works at a foreign-exchange brokerage in Hong Kong, prefers to shield his children from the city’s divisive climate. He considered sending his younger daughter to a local school before the protests escalated, but has since opted for the international system and wants his kids to attend university overseas. “I don’t want my kids to be affected,” Chang said.Other families have come to a similar conclusion but for a different reason. They’re worried that China will respond to Hong Kong’s crisis by pushing for changes in the local school curriculum that make it more nationalistic, said Ruth Benny, who runs Top Schools, a consulting firm.For parents across the ideological spectrum, one common argument in favor international schools is that they may be better suited to prepare kids for a potential life outside Hong Kong.“These parents don’t know what the future holds,” said Murphy, the ITS education consultant. “They want to prepare their kids for leaving the city and going abroad someday.”(Adds link to latest protest news)To contact the reporters on this story: Alfred Liu in Hong Kong at aliu226@bloomberg.net;Lulu Yilun Chen in Hong Kong at ychen447@bloomberg.net;Bei Hu in Hong Kong at bhu5@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jun Luo at jluo6@bloomberg.net, Jonas Bergman, Michael PattersonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P. \" \n",

      " \" Ruben and Maria Martinez are having a honeymoon this week – 12 years after their wedding day.Ruben was arrested in 2007, just five months after they tied the knot, accused of a string of armed robberies in Los Angeles he did not commit. He was sentenced to 47 years in prison in 2008, and for more than a decade Ruben and his wife fought to prove his innocence, with appeals that repeatedly failed.On Tuesday, however, the couple’s prayers were answered. The LA district attorney’s office agreed that Ruben was wrongfully convicted, a judge formally deemed him innocent, and for the first time in more than 4,500 days, Ruben walked free.“This is a divine miracle,” Ruben, now 49, told the Guardian on Thursday, as he sat inside the food pantry in El Monte, just outside of LA, where Maria works. “All of this time crying in my cell, it’s like I was in a dark tunnel … and finally God has brought the light to the darkness.”Ruben and Maria, 59, were giggly and joyful as they discussed his freedom, saying they felt like newlyweds spending their first week together. While exonerations are exceptionally rare, the couple said they never wavered in their belief that this day would come.They had faith to keep them hopeful – as well as a binder of evidence.The two grew up in LA county and met in 2003 at the Victory Outreach church in East LA. They were friends for years and got married on 9 December 2006; Maria carries around a framed photo of them lighting a candle on their wedding day.At the time, Ruben was making ends meet as a day laborer, and on the morning of 1 June 2007, he woke up at 4.30am looking for a gig, leaving the house with only $5 in his wallet. He completed a job moving some furniture and was walking down the street to a liquor store near his home in Boyle Heights when Los Angeles police department officers approached – and arrested him.“I thought something bad had happened to my family,” he said. “I sat in the back of that cop car thinking, what could it be?”The officers took him to a station for questioning, and a detective asked him if he knew why he was arrested. When he said no, the detective asked him to try on a painter’s mask, which Ruben refused to do. Police then asked him if he had tattoos, and when he said he did not, they made him take his shirt off to prove it, he said.“‘Who do you hang around with?’” police continued, according to Ruben. He said it became clear that officers were trying to establish some sort of gang affiliation based on his neighborhood.“They just stereotyped him as a Boyle Heights, East LA Mexican gangbanger,” said Maria.Eventually police told him he was being charged with “second-degree robbery while personally armed with a firearm”.He told the officers he knew nothing about any robberies, and the questioning quickly ended.Maria came home to find police had put up yellow tape and turned her home into a crime scene, executing a search warrant for robbery.“The house was in shambles,” she said.Ruben, who was jailed while awaiting trial, later learned he was being charged with nine felony counts stemming from five robberies between December 2005 and May 2007 at the same Boyle Heights auto body shop – a business he had never patronized. He matched some parts of the victim’s description of the suspect, though the suspect was a bit taller and had been wearing a mask for most of the robberies.The simplest way forward for Ruben was to plead guilty. Prosecutors offered him a plea deal that would give him a two-year sentence, and his lawyer urged him to sign.Ruben never even considered it: “Everybody was telling me to take it … but it wouldn’t be right on my behalf, saying I was a thief. That would be a lie. I don’t believe in lying. If a man’s going to stand, let him stand for the truth.”Maria knew the risks of rejected a deal, but said she always supported her husband’s decision: “He didn’t do it.”After learning the specific robbery dates in court, Maria went through all of Ruben’s pay stubs and found paperwork showing he was working during two of the alleged incidents – on a job at CBS Studios and another at a metal processing facility. The temporary agencies that employed Ruben gave Maria time sheets and a list of people he carpooled with on those days. She gave those to his lawyer, but the attorney did not use the documents during the trial and did not call his alibis from the carpool as witnesses.Related: Hundreds dead, no one charged: the uphill battle against Los Angeles police killingsRuben’s supervisors did testify on his behalf, but prosecutors attacked their credibility, alleging that one was biased and another had made a typo on one time sheet.The only physical evidence from the five crime scenes was a single palm print. It did not match Ruben’s. Police knew one suspect had committed all the crimes and had no evidence from Ruben’s home to connect him to any of the offenses.A first trial in November 2007 ended in a mistrial with a deadlocked jury. Prosecutors moved forward with a second trial, which ended in guilty verdicts on all counts. On 20 May 2008, Ruben was sentenced to 47 years and eight months in state prison.Ruben’s incarceration devastated his whole family.Maria broke down as she recounted the milestones missed: “I got robbed of a lot of stuff. Sharing our first anniversary behind bars, it was so sad.”When Ruben’s nephew was killed the day of his conviction, Maria hid the news, worried he wouldn’t be able to cope. When Ruben’s mother passed away in July 2010, he wasn’t able to go to the funeral. During the holidays each year, his family would honor him by passing around a hat and collecting donations that could go to his prison care packages.After Ruben ended up in a state prison 200 miles away from LA, most of his family couldn’t afford to visit any more.Ruben said the hardest part was the physical separation from Maria: “We lost our time alone, that intimacy where she’s looking into my eyes. We couldn’t share our pain over the phone.”He survived by praying in his cell, he said: “‘Jesus, you know I didn’t do this.’ There’s two people in the room – me and Jesus. And both of us know I didn’t do it.”Maria refused to give up on the case. A former secretary for the sheriff’s department, she kept detailed records of all his files proving his alibis. One of Ruben’s sisters took an early withdrawal from her retirement to pay for an attorney, and his family filed petitions and appeals. The courts denied each one.In 2015, Maria learned she had one final option. The district attorney (DA), Jackie Lacey, had established a new conviction review unit. Without the help of an attorney, Maria put together a claim for Lacey’s office. Maria also had the support of a close friend and retired homicide detective, Catherine Wills, who had become a mother figure to her and twice directly appealed to the prosecutor.And for the first time in a decade, the system took Maria’s binder of evidence seriously. DA investigators interviewed witnesses and alibis and concluded it was not possible that Ruben committed any of the robberies.Ruben’s exoneration is an anomaly in LA county. Since the creation of Lacey’s review unit, he is only the third person to have a conviction reversed – and the first to successfully bring a claim without an attorney. The unit has received more than 1,900 claims during that time.“A lot of people come up to me and say there’s somebody in prison who’s innocent,” Lacey told the Guardian this week. “The moral of the story is you’ve got to listen … Ruben is an inspirational figure, larger than life, no bitterness … They never gave up hope.”Lacey said her office would use Ruben’s case in trainings, adding: “There are mixed emotions when you see a mistake in the system, because you have so much faith in the system.”Ruben will be entitled to $140 for every day of his incarceration, which could amount to more than $600,000. But Lacey acknowledged that could never make up for the suffering of his family: “I can’t even imagine, 11 years … It’s hard to even explain it or think about it.”Maria said she did not have animosity towards the DA’s office: “They’re human, and it’s not their fault. It was just the system.”Ruben immediately celebrated his freedom with a double cheeseburger, fries and a strawberry shake. The next morning, his first day on the outside, he decided to volunteer at the food bank where his wife works. He thought it would be a good way to show his gratitude. \" \n",

      " \" The first time Donald Trump ran for president, the reality TV star presented a novel idea for combating terrorists. “You have to take out their families,” candidate Trump told Fox & Friends. When Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and others pointed out that the policy might “create more enemies than you’re destroying,” Trump went all Servpro on his proposal. Like it never happened.Call it the run-it-up-the-flagpole-and-if-no-one-salutes-it-pretend-you-never-said-it strategy. Whatever you call it, it works for Donald Trump — a president with a unique ability to set the news media’s hair on fire on a daily, sometimes hourly, basis.It also works for me, an American who believes President Ronald Reagan’s warning: “The nine most terrifying words in the English language are ‘I’m from the government, and I’m here to help.’ ” As far as I’m concerned, the less Trump means what he says about “cleaning up” Ukrainian corruption, “banning” flavored vaping or “fixing gun violence,” the happier I feel.Do you really think the government can solve America’s “gun violence” problem — firearms-related suicides, deadly gangbanging and deranged school shooters — by enacting “gun safety” laws? If you do, you might be deluded enough to think that Trump’s decision to abandon his previously stated willingness to seek compromise on the issue is (another) reason to hate the president’s lack of resolve.OUR VIEW: Trump on gun laws is all talk, no action and more deathsFolks, Donald Trump says a lot of things about a lot of things.

      "https://news.yahoo.com/russia-starts-process-returning-captured-102903021.html\n",
      " \" By Maria Kiselyova and Natalia ZinetsMOSCOW/KIEV (Reuters) - Russia on Monday handed back three naval ships it captured last year to Ukraine, something Kiev wanted to happen before a four-way peace summit on eastern Ukraine next month in Paris.The handover, confirmed by the two countries' foreign ministries, occurred in the Black Sea off the coast of Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.Russia seized the ships in the same area in November last year after opening fire on them and wounding several sailors. Moscow said the ships - two small Ukrainian armoured artillery vessels and a tug boat - had illegally entered its territorial waters. Kiev denied that.Russia returned the sailors who had been on board the ships to Ukraine in September as part of a prisoner exchange deal.Various Russian media outlets reported that the ships would be returned to Ukraine on Monday without their ammunition and documentation.Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement Moscow would respond harshly in future to what it called any similar maritime \\\"provocations\\\" near its borders.Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the three captured ships were en route to the port of Odessa.It said that their original voyage, which Russia had interpreted as a border violation, had been peaceful and legal and that Kiev planned to pursue a case against Russia over the matter at an international arbitration panel in the Netherlands.Despite those and other continuing tensions, the handover is likely to be seen as a confidence-building measure ahead of the planned Ukraine summit however.The leaders of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine will meet in Paris on Dec. 9 in an attempt to advance efforts for a peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine, the French presidency said on Friday.More than 13,000 people have been killed in the more than five-year-old conflict in east Ukraine between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian government forces.Relations between Ukraine and Russia collapsed following Moscow's annexation of the Crimean peninsula, which prompted Western sanctions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy won a landslide election victory in April promising to end the conflict.(Editing by Andrew Osborn) \" \n",

      "This Cold War Stealth Bomber Almost Flew From U.S. Navy Aircraft Carriers\n",
      "https://news.yahoo.com/cold-war-stealth-bomber-almost-020000241.html\n",
      " \" Key point: The Navy lacks a heavy-hitting, long-range bomber platform.During the closing stages of the Cold War, the United States Navy was developing a new long-range stealth bomber that could strike at even the most heavily defended targets from the deck of an aircraft carrier. But the ill-fated program was cancelled; leaving a gap in naval aviation capability that has not been filled to this day.  Called the McDonnell Douglas/General Dynamics A-12 Avenger II—a product of the Advanced Tactical Aircraft (ATA) program—the new bomber would have replaced the long-serving Grumman A-6E Intruder. However, as the Soviet threat evaporated, then Defense Secretary Dick Cheney cancelled the A-12 program on January 7, 1991, due to massive cost and schedule overruns as well as severe technical problems. But while the stealthy A-12 had its problems, the bomber’s demise led the Navy to today’s problem: A carrier air wing that does not have the range or penetrating strike capability to defeat advanced anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) capabilities.   While the Lockheed Martin F-35C Joint Strike Fighter will finally bring X-band stealth technology onboard the carrier and the forthcoming MQ-25 Stingray unmanned aerial refueling tanker will help to extend the range of the existing air wing, those aircraft do not make up for the lack of a heavy hitting long-range bomber platform that can strike deep into the heart of enemy territory. Even with the F-35C and MQ-25, the Navy’s carrier air wings would not be able to strike at Chinese targets in the Western Pacific without putting the carrier at considerable risk. Beijing is able to threaten U.S. Navy carriers with anti-ship ballistic missiles such the DF-21D and the DF-26— the later of which has a range of roughly 2000 nautical miles—by forcing those vessels to operate further out at sea.The Navy had envisioned the need for a carrier-based penetrating strike aircraft with extended ranges during the 1980s given rapidly advancing Soviet capabilities. Indeed, as former Center for a New American Security scholar Jerry Hendrix, a retired naval aviator, noted, the initial requirements for the A-12 called for an aircraft with a 1,700 nautical mile combat radius and an internal payload of 6,000lbs with a radar cross section comparable to the Northrop B-2 Spirit strategic bomber.Had the A-12 program panned out, the Navy would still have a potent long-range carrier-based penetrating strike capability that would have been superior to anything currently envisioned. However, technical problems and requirements changes—all of which negatively impacted strike capability—whittled the A-12’s unrefueled combat radius down to 1,000 nautical miles and eventually down to 785 nautical miles. Eventually, as technical problems and program snafus mounted—largely due to “criminal” program management—Cheney was forced to cancel the entire program.Though it was not immediately apparent at the time, with the cancellation of the A-12 program and the retirement of the A-6E, the U.S. Navy gave up its long-range strike capability in favor of an air wing that focused on sortie generation. While that was not a problem in the immediate aftermath of the end of the Cold War, with Russia resurgent and the emergence of China as a great power challenger, it is a serious issue for the viability of the carrier fleet. The Navy’s carrier air wings would have greatly benefited from an A-12-like capability had the program survived.Analysts have proposed solutions such as a long-range stealthy unmanned strike aircraft as a solution to the Navy’s long-range penetrating strike gap, however, there are problems with that solution. Current Pentagon policy prohibits autonomous weapons from making the decision to take a human life on its own volition, which means that human operators have to be in the loop even when the aircraft is deep inside enemy territory. However, adversaries such as Russia and China will attack the vulnerable data-links that control such an unmanned aircraft through electronic attacks, cyber-warfare or a combination of methods. Drones have been hacked before—by insurgents, no less—thus positive control cannot be guaranteed.Human pilots, however, cannot be hacked and can make on-the-spot judgments to engage or change targets etc. without the need to home phone—so to speak. Thus, a modern incarnation of a manned carrier-based long-range penetrating strike aircraft might be a solution to the Navy’s range problem. Modern materials, sensor and propulsion technology—particularly advanced adaptive-cycle engines that are currently in development—would solve most of the technical challenges that stymied the A-12 program.Given that advanced adaptive cycle engines which are currently in development promise to reduce fuel burn by more than 35 percent, a new carrier-based bomber should be able to meet a 1100 nautical mile combat radius requirement even given the size constraints of carrier aircraft. Thus, the Navy should consider the development of a next-generation carrier-based long-range penetrating strike aircraft. Like the original ATA, which was also slated to replace the Boeing F-15E, a modern incarnation of such a warplane could also replace the Strike Eagle while supplementing the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and F-35C on the carrier flight deck. It will not be cheap, but given that President Donald Trump has signaled his intent to invest heavily in the nation’s defense, it is an option that the Navy should consider.Image: Flickr.Read the original article.  \" \n",

      " \" Tal Tamr (Syria) (AFP) - Since fleeing her hometown in northeastern Syria, Suad Simon prays every day for the safety of her husband, who stayed behind with other fighters to defend their majority-Assyrian village.Assyrian Christians like Simon, who escaped the town's occupation by the Islamic State group in 2015 and did not choose to emigrate, now anxiously watch the advance of Turkish forces towards their villages in the south of Hasakeh province.Ankara is still trying to gain ground despite two ceasefire agreements reached last month to put an end to its offensive against the Kurdish-dominated region.Simon, 56, fled her village of Tal Kefji that is not far from areas still hit by sporadic fighting and sought refuge with a relative in Tal Tamr to the south.\\\"We women left because we were afraid of the bombings,\\\" said Simon, sitting in the corner of an earthen house where she had lit candles for her husband.\\\"We just want peace,\\\" she said. \\\"I left behind so many memories... my husband, my house, my family and neighbours.\\\"Her husband had joined the Khabur Guards, a small Christian militia that took up the defence of more than thirty Assyrian villages in 2015 with the help of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.Ankara launched a cross-border invasion of the Kurdish-controlled region on October 9 to push back the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), the backbone of the SDF, which it deems a \\\"terrorist\\\" group.- 'Long-time enemies' -The operation has seen the Turkish army occupy a strip spanning some 120 kilometres (75 miles) of the border.Around 150 civilians have been killed in the fighting and a further 300,000 displaced, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.Despite two ceasefires, Turkish forces and their Syrian proxies have taken control of dozens of towns, including some Assyrian-majority villages, the Britain-based monitor said.\\\"There are Turkish threats to attack our villages and many are fleeing,\\\" 48-year-old Assyrian Aisho Nissan told AFP in Tal Tamr.\\\"The fate of the region remains uncertain, we are afraid for our children and our families.\\\"In Tal Tamr, cars and buses loaded with people and their belongings can be seen heading south, most towards the city of Hasakeh, where hundreds of families fleeing the violence have taken shelter.At the headquarters of the Assyrian militia, spokesman Nabil Warde said the Turks are \\\"our long-time enemies\\\", referencing the 1915-1918 massacres of Armenians and Assyrian-Chaldeans under the Ottoman Empire.\\\"It's the second time we have faced an offensive, the first by Daesh and this time by the Turks,\\\" he said, using another name for IS.The fertile region of Khabur was taken in February 2015 by IS, who kidnapped at least 220 Christian Assyrians before later releasing them in exchange for ransom.IS was pushed from its last stronghold in the area by Kurdish-led forces early this year.- 'Exile' -Approximately 20,000 people lived in the 35 Assyrian villages in Khabur before the IS invasion, but only about 1,000 now remain, said Warde.Of those who left, many have emigrated to the United States, Australia and Canada.Before the start of the war in Syria in 2011, Assyrians made up around 30,000 of the 1.2 million Christians in Syria.In his village of Tal Nasri, 50-year-old Sarkoun Selio, who is one of the few Assyrians still living there, stood in a church destroyed by IS in 2015, accompanied by two militiamen.Only the stone skeleton of the building still stands, while its large iron cross lies in a corner of the courtyard.One of the militiamen picked up a torn page of gospel written in Assyrian.\\\"In 2015, we were attacked by the terrorists of Daesh,\\\" said Nasri, voicing worry over what more violence will mean for the community.\\\"We fear that the last of our Assyrian people will be pushed into exile.\\\" \" \n",

      "https://news.yahoo.com/china-defends-crackdown-muslim-minorities-142415156.html\n",
      " \" China defended on Monday its crackdown on Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang region after a document leak to the New York Times revealed the details of Beijing’s concerted repression efforts.On Friday the Times published papers leaked from within China’s Communist party that detailed directives to party officials on how to handle the detention of Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other Muslims as part of what China asserts is a campaign against Islamic extremism. Chinese president Xi Jinping was quoted as saying the government should show “absolutely no mercy” in its crackdown.“It is precisely because of a series of preventive counterterrorism and de-extremism measures taken in a timely manner that Xinjiang, which had been deeply plagued by terrorism, has not had a violent terrorist incident for three years,” foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters on Monday.China has detained roughly one million Muslims in Xinjiang, housing them in so-called reeducation camps meant to reduce prisoners’ identification with Islam and foster obedience toward the Communist party, according to international human rights groups. According to former inmates, Chinese government and military personnel regularly torture and rape prisoners. One report indicated China is pairing ethnic Han men to women whose husbands have been detained.The Communist party-owned newspaper The Global Times reported that Uighur families with members who escaped China were actually happy with their lives. “They are ashamed of the scum among their families,” the report said.In October, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced sanctions on Chinese officials believed to participate in the repression of Uighurs and other minorites.“China must end its draconian surveillance and repression, release all those arbitrarily detained, and cease its coercion of Chinese Muslims abroad,” Pompeo wrote on Twitter at the time. \" \n",

      "https://news.yahoo.com/minneapolis-police-admit-discovering-1-170953461.html\n",
      " \" The Minneapolis Police Department announced Friday that a 2015 count of rape kits collected from survivors came up terribly short, missing more than 1,500 rape kits held in police storage facilities.Minnesota passed a law in 2015 that required law enforcement agencies to audit their backlogged kits. But after conducting a new review this year, the Minneapolis police said at a press conference on Friday, that 1,700 untested rape kits spanning over 30 years have been discovered — far more than the 194 kits found in 2015.Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said that he doesn’t know why there was a miscount, but said that there are now safeguards in place to prevent this from happening again.“We had failure in terms of the auditing process of those kits. That is unacceptable,” Arradondo said.Deputy Chief Erick Fors said it’s taken about two years to have all the kits tested at police departments testing a similar quantity of backlogged kits.The department has already sent 60 to 80 of the new kits to be tested, and that they are looking to recruit three additional analysts to conduct the tests, Fors said.“We have a debt to have these kits tested,” Fors said.Over the last decade, police departments across the country have faced a reckoning about vast catalogues of rape kits that have sat untested in police storage facilities for years. The kits, which are physically invasive for victims and can take four hours to complete, are used to convict perpetrators— and to track serial sex offenders. Advocates have argued that rape kit backlogs are a sign that police departments often fail to take sexual assault seriously.Fors said that the kits have been properly stored and maintained. The department is still working to conduct a final count of the backlogged kits, which are stored in “voluminous” warehouses that may contain evidence spanning back as far as 100 years, Fors said.Fors said that the police will be working with advocacy groups to ensure that victims will be treated with care.Kenosha Davenport, executive director of the Sexual Violence Center, said that the age of some of these kits makes contacting victims especially complicated.“We’re going to have victims that have maybe not shared this with their partners, or maybe not shared this with their children. They’re in a different timeframe of their life,” Davenport said. “That’s why it’s so critical that the notification process and the protocols around that is done diligently and with the support of advocates so that we can continue to support them on their healing journey.” \" \n",

      "https://news.yahoo.com/brooke-skylar-richardson-biggest-regret-191909871.html\n",
      " \" It’s been nearly three years since 18-year-old Brooke Skylar Richardson gave birth alone, in her family home, and buried the baby in her backyard. She’s been through a grueling trial—charged with aggravated murder, involuntary manslaughter, and child endangerment—and endured a national media circus. But to this day, Richardson says her biggest regret is not telling someone when she discovered she was pregnant.Richardson was acquitted of the most serious charges against her last month, in a trial that transfixed her small town of Carlisle, Ohio, and made headlines across the country. Critics dubbed the teenager a “baby killer” and started Facebook groups calling for her murder, while supporters claimed her case set a dangerous precedent for pregnant women..In her first interview since the trial, Richardson told Cosmopolitan she spent much of that time agitating over what happened to her baby, whom she named Annabelle. Every night, she told Cosmo, “I would lie down and wish that I could have died in place of Annabelle.”“I wish I would have done it differently,” she added. “I’m plagued by guilt every day for not telling someone.”Ohio Cheerleader Found Not Guilty of Murdering Her Newborn BabyRichardson discovered she was pregnant in April 2017, at a gynecologist appointment her mother had arranged to get her birth control. Instead of prescribing the pill, however, the doctor informed her she was 32 weeks along. Then 18 years old, and focused on finishing her senior year of high school, Richardson told no one.Weeks later—on her senior prom night, weeks before the baby was due—Richardson gave birth in her family bathroom. To this day, she maintains it was a stillbirth. (“I did not hurt, harm, or kill Annabelle,” she told Cosmo.) Panicked, she ran outside and dug a shallow grave in her backyard. She covered it with pink flower petals.Months after, when Richardson finally told a doctor the outcome of the pregnancy, the doctor reported her to authorities for suspected child abuse. Police assigned to the case questioned her for hours, until she admitted to trying to cremate the remains. Later, her defense team would say this confession was coerced, and the prosecution’s own expert witness would also say there was no evidence of burning.But as news of her story spread, people in Richardson’s town and beyond started calling her a monster. Friends and classmates lined up in front of her house to take pictures, and commenters on social media called for her death.“It was the worst nightmare,” her mother, Kim Richardson, previously told 48 Hours. “Purgatory every day. Our lives have been completely turned upside-down.”Brooke told Cosmo that she felt “like I was dying” during the trial. “Very few things have been harder than having to listen to prosecutors allege horrible, unthinkable things of me and put countless photos of my daughter’s bones on a big screen,” she said.Cheerleader Accused of Murdering, Burying Newborn Goes on TrialEven now, after a jury found her not guilty on three different charges, the scrutiny on Richardson remains. Hours after her acquittal, when she went to a gathering with friends, someone sent pictures to the media. In October, relatives of her baby’s father organized a candlelight vigil for Annabelle at a local community center. Now 20 years old, Richardson has been unable to join her friends at college or even find a job beyond a part-time role with the law firm that represented her. Her eating disorder—which became a fixture of the dramatic coverage around her case—has persisted, and she has also been diagnosed with mild PTSD and severe depression.“I’m still living with a lot of fear,” Richardson told Cosmo. “The past two years have been nothing short of a nightmare. After being constantly afraid and paranoid of everyone and everything around me, I’m having a hard time letting that go.”Richardson will still have to serve three years on probation for the one charge on which the jury found her guilty—gross abuse of a corpse. Still, she has signed up for paralegal classes at a community college, and says she plans to seek treatment for her eating disorders. She hopes to eventually work for the Ohio Innocence Project.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

    "text =  \" Police breached a Hong Kong university campus held by protesters early Monday after an all-night siege that included firing repeated barrages of tear gas and water cannons.Anti-government protesters have barricaded themselves inside Hong Kong Polytechnic University for days. Police surrounded the area Sunday night and began moving in after issuing an ultimatum for people to leave the area. The crowd wore raincoats and carried umbrellas to shield themselves.Riot officers broke in one entrance before dawn as fires raged inside and outside the school, but they didn’t appear to get very far. Fiery explosions could be seen as protesters responded with gasoline bombs. Police, who have warned that everyone in the area could be charged with rioting, reportedly made a handful of arrests.At daybreak, protesters remained in control of most of the campus. In one outdoor area, some demonstrators made gasoline bombs while others dozed while wearing gas masks. Two walked about with bows and quivers of arrows, while many stared at their smartphones.A lull settled on the area as the president of the university said in a video message that that police have agreed to suspend their use of force.Jin-Guang Teng said police would allow protesters to leave and he would accompany them to the police station to ensure their cases would be processed fairly.“I hope that you will accept the proposed temporary suspension of force and leave the campus in a peaceful manner,” he said.It seemed unlikely the protesters would accept the offer given that they would all likely be arrested.A few hundred streamed out of the campus about 8:15 a.m. in an apparent bid to escape, but they were driven back by police tear gas. Some wearing gas masks calmly picked up smoking tear gas canisters and dropped them into heavy-duty bags, but the protesters decided to retreat with a phalanx of officers lined up across the road in the distance.On Sunday, protesters used bows and arrows, and one arrow struck a media liaison officer in the calf. Photos on the department’s Facebook page show the arrow sticking out of the back of the officer’s leg through his pants.As riot police moved in from all sides, some protesters retreated inside the university. Others set fires on bridges leading to it.A huge blaze burned along much of a long footbridge that connects a train station to the campus over the approach to the Cross-Harbour Tunnel, a major road under Hong Kong’s harbor that has been blocked by protesters for days.The use of bows and arrows and gasoline bombs was a sharp escalation of violence by the protesters, who are trying to keep the pressure on Hong Kong leaders, who have rejected most of their demands.The protests started peacefully in early June, sparked by proposed legislation that would have criminal suspects to be extradited to the mainland. But by the time the bill was withdrawn, the protests had hardened and broadened into a resistance movement against the territory’s government and Beijing.Activists see the extradition bill as an example of Hong Kong’s eroding autonomy under Beijing rule since the 1997 handover from colonial power Britain.
