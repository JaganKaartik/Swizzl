      "https://news.yahoo.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-says-impeachment-inquiry-is-at-the-point-of-no-return-182636649.html\n",
      " \"  WASHINGTON — Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who began calling for President Trump to be impeached earlier this year, believes we have now reached “the point of no return” where it is inarguably clear that he has committed criminal acts. Ocasio-Cortez discussed the issue with Yahoo News on Capitol Hill on Tuesday as the third day of public hearings was being conducted in the Democrats’ ongoing impeachment inquiry.“We’re kind of knee-deep here in impeachment inquiry and so at this point, I think we’re beyond the question as to whether Trump has committed a crime or whether he’s violated the Constitution,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “He’s clearly engaged in extortion and bribery.”When Ocasio-Cortez began calling for impeachment, she said the president had done “so many things ... that are impeachable,” including violating the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution by receiving payments from foreign countries while in office and engaging in possible tax fraud. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was initially reluctant to impeach Trump, launched a formal inquiry in September following revelations of a complaint from an intelligence community whistleblower who alleged that military assistance to Ukraine was withheld as Trump pushed that country to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival. On Tuesday, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who worked on the White House National Security Council, testified that he had raised concerns internally about U.S. officials who pushed for an investigation into Biden. Vindman also said he warned Ukraine’s newly elected president that it would be improper for him to get involved with political matters in this country. Ocasio-Cortez said the testimony from witnesses so far has made it abundantly clear that Trump engaged in criminal conduct with respect to Ukraine. At this point, she said, the only remaining question is how many illegal acts were committed and who else was involved. “It’s not just Trump, but who else is going to be implicated in this,” Ocasio-Cortez said, adding, “I think, when it comes to what we’ve discovered, we’re at the point of no return, and it’s just a question of how many crimes have been potentially committed and who else has committed them.”Trump has repeatedly insisted that his interest in investigations into business dealings Biden’s son had in Ukraine was part of a desire to root out corruption in that country. He has characterized the impeachment inquiry as a partisan effort by Democrats to oust him.Ocasio-Cortez has become one of the more prominent progressives in Congress since she was elected in a surprising upset last year. Some Republican allies of the president have tried to cast her as a major driver of the impeachment push. Ed Cox, who is President Richard Nixon’s son-in-law and a former chairman of the New York Republican Party, appeared on Fox News on Monday and said the “AOC effect” was “driving” impeachment. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who has emerged as a prominent impeachment opponent on Capitol Hill, has boasted that she is “proudly the opposite of AOC.” Trump has regularly singled out Ocasio-Cortez for criticism on his Twitter feed. He has also sent tweets suggesting the whistleblower who sparked the impeachment inquiry should be outed, and mocking Democrats who have backed the investigation. On Nov. 15, as Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, testified in an impeachment hearing, Trump sent a tweet criticizing her job performance. Democrats have suggested that tweet was potential witness tampering. Trump responded by arguing it was “free speech.”For her part, Ocasio-Cortez said Trump’s tweets singling out impeachment critics constitute a “very disturbing pattern.” “Of course he’s trying to undermine the process. He’s clearly engaged in witness intimidation,” she said. _____Download the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.Read more from Yahoo News:Rebuilding Paradise: A year after the Camp Fire, one couple finds healing in starting overKey Democrat: House needs to 'keep this simple' in crafting impeachment articlesAs Supreme Court weighs DACA, Trump pushes fiction about 'hardened criminals'‘The 360’: What is quid pro quo and does it matter?PHOTOS: 10 bronze statues of inspirational women in NYC by Statues for Equality\\\" \" \n",

      "Obama aides deny they left behind nasty notes when they departed White House — in 2017\n",
      "https://news.yahoo.com/stephanie-grisham-obama-trump-transition-you-will-fail-165033730.html\n",
      " \" Alumni of the Obama administration reacted with disbelief and outrage to a claim from White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham that incoming Trump administration officials found insulting notes left behind for them in their offices.“We came into the White House, I’ll tell you something,” said Grisham during a local radio interview Tuesday morning, as reported by CNN’s Abby Phillip. “Every office was filled with Obama books, and we had notes left behind that said, ‘You will fail,’ ‘You aren’t going to make it.’” She didn’t elaborate on what she meant by “Obama books.”In the nearly three years since the presidential transition, no Trump administration officials have mentioned the notes or produced any photos that would support Grisham’s charge. “This is another bald faced lie,” wrote Susan Rice, who served as national security adviser. In a statement to NBC News responding to Rice’s tweet, Grisham clarified her statement, stating that she didn’t mean to suggest that the notes were left in every White House office, only in a press area.“I’m not sure where her office was, and I certainly wasn’t implying every office had that issue,” Grisham wrote, referring to Rice’s office. “In fact, I had a lovely note left for me in the East Wing, and I tracked the woman down and thanked her. I was talking specifically about our experience in the lower press office — nowhere else. I don’t know why everyone is so sensitive!”Additional officials who worked across the Obama administration strongly disputed Grisham’s claim on Twitter.“100% false,” wrote Liz Allen, who worked as a deputy communications director. “I left a note wishing them good luck serving the American people and offering to be a resource.”“This is a lie,” wrote Ben Rhodes, a foreign policy adviser for Obama. “If this happened I also don’t think the entire Trump staff would wait 3 years to tell us. Sad to see the WH press secretary fall this far.” “I was there,” wrote Daniel Jacobson, who worked in the White House counsel’s office. “This is a complete and utter lie. Quite the opposite — we left them briefing books to try to help with the transition as much as possible.”Since taking office, President Trump has frequently complained about the “mess” he inherited from his predecessor, but generally in reference to domestic and international policy, not the conditions of the offices in the White House.A report from the General Accounting Office in 2002 concluded that outgoing Clinton administration officials had caused damage amounting to $13,000 to $14,000 to White House offices before George W. Bush’s inauguration, including by removing the “W” keys from keyboards.Grisham was named press secretary this summer, moving over from the office of the first lady after a history of misstatements. Grisham provided false information in 2018 about a controversial jacket worn by first lady Melania Trump and misstated the day of Trump’s 2016 visit to Scotland, which he claimed took place before the vote on the Brexit resolution but was actually the day after. Grisham’s predecessor, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, was found in special counsel Robert Mueller’s report to have lied about the firing of FBI Director James Comey. Sanders’s predecessor, Sean Spicer, provided conflicting information on Comey’s May 2017 termination._____Download the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.Read more from Yahoo News:Rebuilding Paradise: A year after the Camp Fire, one couple finds healing in starting overKey Democrat: House needs to 'keep this simple' in crafting impeachment articlesAs Supreme Court weighs DACA, Trump pushes fiction about 'hardened criminals'‘The 360’: What is quid pro quo and does it matter?PHOTOS: 10 bronze statues of inspirational women in NYC by Statues for Equality\\\" \" \n",

      "https://news.yahoo.com/lawyer-nsc-adviser-vindman-sends-204853373.html\n",
      " \" A lawyer for Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman sent a letter to Fox News on Wednesday demanding the network either retract or issue a correction for a segment of the The Ingraham Angle, in which guest John Yoo, a former top lawyer in the Bush administration, seemed to suggest that Vindman might be guilty of espionage.Vindman, who listened to the July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky that forms part of the impeachment probe, testified in House hearings on Tuesday regarding the matter. Vindman is a long-serving military officer whose family fled Soviet Ukraine when he was three years old.During the October 28 airing of “The Ingraham Angle,” host Laura Ingraham speculated on Vindman’s motives for testifying.“Here we have a U.S. national security official who is advising Ukraine, while working inside the White House, apparently against the president’s interest,” Ingraham said. “Isn’t that kind of an interesting angle on this story?”“I found that astounding,” Yoo responded. “Some people might call that espionage.”“LTC Vindman and his family have been forced to examine options, including potentially moving onto a military base, in order to ensure their physical security in the face of threats rooted in the falsehood that Fox News originated,” Vindman’s lawyer David Pressman wrote.Pressman noted that espionage is a crime punishable by death, and that Vindman “had never in his decorated 20-year career of service to his country been accused of having dual loyalties or committing espionage.”A spokeswoman for Fox News said she had no immediate comment when asked by the New York Times.Yoo wrote an op-ed in USA Today after the segment aired in which he clarified that he meant Ukraine may have committed an espionage operation, but that he didn’t accuse Vindman specifically of espionage.Pressman wrote in his letter that “Mr. Yoo’s argument that he did not intend to accuse LTC of Vindman of ‘espionage’ — that he was accusing the nation of Ukraine instead — is as legally irrelevant as it is factually incredible.”GOP Rep.

      "https://news.yahoo.com/police-white-teen-girl-aimed-185432649.html\n",
      " \" ATLANTA (AP) — A white 16-year-old girl is accused of plotting to attack a mostly black church in a north Georgia city, where police say she planned to kill worshippers because of their race.Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church has a predominantly black congregation, Gainesville Police Chief Jay Parrish said in a statement Tuesday.“Our investigation indicated the church was targeted by the juvenile based on the racial demographic of the church members,” he said.Students, school administrators and law officers worked together to thwart a “potentially horrific incident,” he added.Police did not release her name.The plot came to light when Gainesville High School students told administrators the 16-year-old had a notebook with detailed plans to kill worshippers at the church, Parrish said.“It just grieves my spirit on a number of different levels, one that the intentions of this young person were so calculated to do great harm against people who just simply had no knowledge of such a plot,” said the Rev. Rose Johnson Mackey, director of the Newtown Florist Club, a civil rights organization founded in Gainesville 70 years ago.The girl is charged with criminal attempt to commit murder, the police chief said. She’s being held in a youth detention center in Gainesville.Details of the alleged plot haven’t been released, but Parrish said it came to light Friday when school administrators contacted police.“We’re just very pleased that our police department acted so swiftly, and the police department in conjunction with our school administrators were just on top of the situation,” Mackey said.Gainesville is about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Atlanta. It’s a city of just over 40,000 people, about 17% of whom are African-American.Rev. Dr. Michelle Rizer-Pool, who leads the congregation at Bethel AME, said she was shocked when notified by police about the alleged attempt.“When I found out I drove to the church, went inside it and prayed and anointed my church and asked God to put a hedge of protection around us,” she said in a telephone interview. “That was on Friday. On Sunday, I tried to relay what was going on without a lot of emotion so that the congregants would remain calm ...“You know, I’ve been preaching for a while now about being on the battlefield, being a soldier in God’s army and that if you believe that God is in charge, he won’t allow hurt or harm to come your way. One of my members told me, ‘You’ve been getting us ready.’ I guess I have.”Rizer-Pool has pastored the church and its approximately 40 members since June 2018. She said the congregation recently celebrated 118 years of service in the community.“I had asked for active shooting training for the church prior to this but it never happened. Still, I had done a few things to keep us as safe as possible like upgrading the security system, locking the back door and reminding our ushers, our first line of defense, just to be aware of people we don’t know,” she said.The South has a long history of black churches being bombed, burned and shot up.White supremacist Dylann Roof fatally shot nine black church members during their Bible study lesson at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in June 2015. Roof later told FBI agents he had hoped the killings would start a race war.More recently, the white son of a sheriff’s deputy was arrested in April and accused of a setting fires that destroyed three black churches in rural Louisiana. Holden Matthews is awaiting trial on arson and hate crimes charges in the Louisiana church burnings.___Associated Press writer Chevel Johnson contributed to the report from New Orleans. \" \n",

      "Homeless Numbers in San Francisco Much Worse, According to City Data\n",
      "https://news.yahoo.com/homeless-numbers-san-francisco-much-200436971.html\n",
      " \" Many cities across California this year announced sharp increases in homelessness. Yet data from San Francisco suggest the real picture might be a lot worse.For years, city governments have measured homelessness by sending out volunteers on a single night to count, as best they could, the number of homeless people they found on the streets or in shelters. By this method San Francisco this year reported 8,011 homeless people, a 17% increase over 2017, the last time a count was conducted.But San Francisco has another, arguably more comprehensive, way of measuring homelessness, and the results are even more alarming.Over the course of a full year, the city counted twice as many homeless people — 17,595 people, a 30% jump from the previous year.The data, which are rarely cited in debates on homelessness, come from a city database of homeless people who receive health care and other services from the city.The latest data are from the 2019 fiscal year, which ended in June. If people sought services multiple times during the course of the year they are counted only once.The 30% jump was by far the largest increase of the past eight years, according to the city’s data. Rachael Kagan, the spokeswoman for the city’s Department of Public Health, said this is partly because in the 2019 fiscal year the city conducted an assessment “blitz,” proactively seeking out homeless people at shelters and hospitals.For around 1,272 people, it was the first time they were entered into the city’s databases.There is no perfect way to measure homelessness, which by nature is transient. Kagan believes the higher numbers are the “most complete picture that we have” of homelessness. But she said it is still likely to be an underestimate.“It does not include people who did not seek services, so it is still an incomplete picture,” she said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.© 2019 The New York Times Company \" \n",

They are asking for the expulsion of students involved in racist incidents, the hiring of more diverse counselors, and diversity training for tenured staff.Some students have been supporting the sit-in by donating to a GoFundMe campaign, which has raised more than $8,000 to feed and support the protesters.Read more:An expert in fraternity hazing deaths says coddling parents are part of the problemThere have been 5 fraternity deaths this school year alone, but little is being done to curb dangerous frat behaviorA fraternity at Penn State has been suspended after a 17-year-old high schooler died at an off-campus houseOhio University suspended all 15 fraternities on-campus after National Hazing Prevention Week was followed by 7 hazing allegationsNOW WATCH: The best ice-cream sandwiches in LA \" \n",

      " \" By K. Sophie WillLONDON, Nov 20 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Extinction Rebellion activists pressing for more rapid action on climate change threats on Wednesday entered a third day of a week-long hunger strikes in 27 countries.The strikes, which began Monday, have been in part spearheaded by 20-year-old Giovanni Tamacas, a University of San Diego student, who carried out a solo hunger strike last month in front of the White House.“We are hunger striking because we have no choice,\\\" he said in a statement, arguing governments and corporations \\\"have criminally and catastrophically failed to tackle the climate and ecological emergency\\\".In the United States, activists started their strike by occupying the office of U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who protesters said has refused to participate in a filmed interview with movement members.Pelosi did issue a statement saying she was \\\"inspired\\\" by young climate activists and that U.S. Democrats were \\\"working relentlessly to safeguard our environment and ensure a healthy, sustainable world for our children\\\".In Britain, a handful of activists protested at headquarters of the Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat parties, similarly demanding that candidates in upcoming British elections submit to filmed interviews with Extinction Rebellion members.Activists around the world signed up to carry out hunger strikes in countries ranging from the Democratic Republic of Congo to New Zealand, Pakistan and Turkey, Extinction Rebellion organisers said.Extinction Rebellion campaigners said the strikes were being carried out in solidarity with people facing worsening hunger as a result of climate change and was aimed at highlighting \\\"the lack of compassion\\\" of many in power.“You would rather watch communities be destroyed by the catastrophic hurricanes and floods the climate crisis will bring” than act on the threats, charged 17-year-old activist Sohia Kianni, from Virginia, in a statement.The Extinction Rebellion movement uses peaceful civil disobedience to highlight the risks posed by climate change and accelerating species losses in the natural world.It has called for governments to set a 2025 deadline to reduce climate-changing emissions to net zero, to declare climate emergencies and to set up citizen assemblies to give people a great voice in political decision making.More than 1,800 Extinction Rebellion activists were arrested during two weeks of disruptive street protests in October in London, police said.(Reporting by K.

      " \" Key point: The bomber threat has returned.Russia’s much-feared Tupolev Tu-22M3 Backfire is getting a new upgrade and is adding a new long-range supersonic missile called the Kh-32. The upgrade will allow the massive jet to once again hit allied targets across the North Atlantic region just as the Backfire once did during the Cold War. The bomber and its new weapon will be delivered to the Russian Aerospace Forces in October.“According to the existing plan, the first Tu-22M3M with the most advanced Kh-32 long-range cruise missile will go on combat duty in long-range aviation in October this year,\\\" a Russian defense industry source told the state-owned TASS news agency.The addition of the powerful Kh-32—an advanced derivative of the Cold War-era Raduga Kh-22 or AS-4 Kitchen—gives the upgraded Tu-22M3 a formidable strike capability not just against ships, but against all manner of strategic targets in Europe. While the massive Kh-22 was designed to destroy American aircraft carriers, the new Kh-32 seems to be designed to hit a wider range of targets including bridges, military bases, electric power plants and other large installations at standoff distances.Recommended: How China Plans to Win a War Against the U.S. NavyRecommended: How the Air Force Would Destroy North KoreaRecommended: 10 Reasons No Nation Wants to Fight Israel While the Russians describe the Kh-32 as long-range supersonic cruise missile, the weapon has many of the characteristics on an aero-ballistic missile. Powered by a liquid-fuel rocket motor, the missile is designed to climb to above 130,000ft before diving towards its target. According to Russian sources, the Kh-32 has speed about Mach 5 and has range of over 1000 kilometers or roughly 600 miles.

      "https://news.yahoo.com/fbi-seeks-interview-with-cia-whistleblower-121637359.html\n",
      " \"  WASHINGTON — The FBI recently sought to question the CIA whistleblower who filed a complaint over President Trump’s July 25 Ukraine call — a move that came after a vigorous internal debate within the bureau over how to respond to some of the issues raised by the complaint’s allegations and whether they needed to be more thoroughly investigated, according to sources familiar with the matter.An FBI agent in the Washington field office in October reached out to one of the lawyers representing the whistleblower and asked to question the CIA analyst who triggered the congressional inquiry into the president’s conduct, one of the sources said. But no interview has yet to be scheduled. It is unclear what the intended scope of the interview would be or whether the whistleblower’s lawyers will agree to it. Mark Zaid, one of the lawyers for the whistleblower, said he and his co-counsel would have no comment. An FBI spokesperson also declined comment. The request from the FBI comes at a sensitive moment when Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee are making repeated efforts to “out” the whistleblower in order to suggest he may have had political motivations hostile to the president when he filed his Aug. 12 complaint with the intelligence community’s inspector general. It also comes after multiple threats have been made against the whistleblower and his lawyers — some of which have been separately passed along by the lawyers to other officials at the FBI. But the agent who sought to question the whistleblower made no reference to the threats as the purpose of the interview, according to sources familiar with the discussions.    Any investigation by the FBI into the issues raised in the whistleblower complaint has the potential to introduce a new wild card into the debate over whether to impeach the president over his Ukraine dealings. In late September, the Justice Department confirmed that Brian Benczkowski, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department’s criminal division, and an appointee of Trump, had reviewed the whistleblower’s detailed complaint the previous month and determined there was no violation of campaign finance laws by the president when he asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open up an investigation into the gas company that once paid Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, to serve on its board.As a result, Kerri Kupec, chief of public affairs, said the Justice Department determined that “no further action was warranted.”But that decision, a Justice Department official said, was limited only to the question of potential campaign finance law violations and not to any other issues raised in the whistleblower complaint. “It was a very narrow issue,” the official said. Some officials within the FBI, which received its own copy of the whistleblower’s complaint in early September, chafed at a Justice Department move they believed was aimed at shutting down any inquiry at all, especially into potential counterintelligence issues raised by the allegations, according to a former senior U.S intelligence official who has discussed the matter with current FBI counterintelligence agents.  There were “guys who wanted to run with it,” said the former senior official. “People were pissed off.”Others in the FBI were wary and “didn’t want to touch [the whistleblower complaint] with a 10-foot pole because of the Russia investigation,” said this former senior official.FBI counterintelligence officials were particularly concerned about the claims — detailed in the whistleblower’s complaint — that the president’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani and two of his associates may have been manipulated by Russian interests, said the former senior official. The two associates in question are Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas, both of whom were recently indicted by federal prosecutors for allegedly conspiring to funnel foreign money into U.S. elections.“There were guys within the [intelligence community] who believe this is another Russian attempt,” the former official said. “People think Giuliani is being led down the primrose path.”One question likely to be raised by the FBI’s inquiry is why the bureau is still interested in talking to the whistleblower given that the House has since taken testimony from others who have far more direct knowledge of the White House’s interactions on Ukraine issues. Yet, largely overlooked in the impeachment debate so far is that the CIA analyst, whose complaint was forwarded to the FBI, specifically raised his concerns in the context of an intelligence threat to the country. “I am also concerned that these actions pose risks to U.S. national security and undermine the U.S. Government’s efforts to deter and counter foreign interference in U.S. elections,” the analyst wrote.  Attached to the seven-page complaint was a classified appendix that has since been partially released. But one of the sections and a footnote to the appendix have been blacked out by the intelligence community and remain classified. _____Download the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.Read more from Yahoo News:Rebuilding Paradise: A year after the Camp Fire, one couple finds healing in starting overKey Democrat: House needs to ‘keep this simple’ in crafting impeachment articlesAs Supreme Court weighs DACA, Trump pushes fiction about ‘hardened criminals’‘The 360’: What is quid pro quo and does it matter?PHOTOS: 10 bronze statues of inspirational women in NYC by Statues for Equality \" \n",

      "https://news.yahoo.com/impeachment-hearings-trump-ukraine-scandal-232413074.html\n",
      " \" In physics, the speed of light is supposed to be a constant. Math has the ratio known as pi, as well as a number of other constants. Politics has, as its constant, President Donald Trump’s approval rating.It has been lodged between 41% and 43% for nearly two years in the FiveThirtyEight adjusted average. The only real exception came during the government shutdown at the beginning of this year, when the rating broke out to the downside for a month. As of Tuesday, Trump's approval was 41.3%.This consistency — unique in the presidential polling — has many political pros characterizing the impeachment hearings, so riveting within the confines of the Beltway, as inconsequential.The temptation might be to dismiss an impeachment process when Senate Republicans have already signaled that they are unlikely to convict Trump even if the president's impeached by the House.And for millions of Americans not particularly tuned in to Washington and who take their cues from pocketbook issues closer to home, the temptation might also be to see the inquiry — like the endless partisan wrangling over Benghazi, Libya, during the Obama administration — as just another dispute between Republicans and Democrats.It is not. There is nothing remotely normal or proper about the way Trump has conducted business since the outset of his presidency. On occasion after occasion he has endeavored to turn important bulwarks of democracy —  prosecutors, the judiciary and the Federal Reserve, to name a few — into obedient servants of his political interests.FREEDOMWORKS: Democrats have weaponized the impeachment hearings Nowhere has he done this with more malice than in the Ukraine scandal. The testimony so far, including Tuesday's from a decorated Army lieutenant colonel, supports the thesis that Trump's goal was to co-opt America’s national security apparatus to pressure a foreign head of state to do him a personal favor.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats have begun to refer to this as bribery. Perhaps a better word is extortion. Trump threatened to withhold a face-to-face meeting and much-needed military aid if Ukraine’s president did not give him political investigations he wanted, including one into potential 2020 rival Joe Biden.This is not something that can be shrugged off as merely inappropriate, even if the aid was eventually released after a whistleblower's complaint made its way to Congress.This is a major abuse of power and a threat to democratic governance. Its closest parallel is Watergate, only with the president personally directing the break-in rather than merely trying to cover it up.Those who don’t stand up to these abuses will be judged by voters and by history, and not in flattering ways..oembed-frame {width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;border:0;}USA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

      "https://news.yahoo.com/son-former-german-president-stabbed-072828350.html\n",
      " \" BERLIN (AP) — The son of former German president Richard von Weizsaecker was stabbed to death while he was giving a lecture at a hospital in Berlin where he worked as a head physician, police said Wednesday.A 57-year-old German man is in custody after he jumped up from the audience at the Schlosspark-Klinik and attacked Fritz von Weizsaecker with a knife on Tuesday evening.An off-duty police officer in the audience who tried to stop the attack was seriously wounded and had to undergo surgery.Von Weizsaecker died at the scene from a knife wound to the neck despite immediate attention from colleagues, said Martin Steltner, a spokesman for Berlin prosecutors.The attacker, whose name has not been released for privacy reasons, has been found to be suffering from psychological problems and is being held in a secure facility while the case is investigated, Steltner said.The suspect, from the southwestern state of Rhineland-Palatinate, had no personal relationship with von Weizsaecker but appears to have been motivated by a “delusional” and “general dislike of the victim’s family,” Steltner said without elaborating.The 59-year-old was the son of one of Germany’s most esteemed presidents. Richard von Weizsaecker became West Germany’s head of state in 1984 and when the country was unified, became the first president of the new nation, serving until 1994. He died in 2015.Fritz von Weizsaecker was one of the ex-president’s four children. His sister Beatrice posted a picture of Jesus on the cross on Instagram after the killing of her brother and wrote, “Take care of my brother ...”Both politicians and colleagues expressed shock over the brazen murder.Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed her condolences to his widow and the family, her spokesman said.“We don’t know much about what happened here in Berlin last night,” spokesman Steffen Seibert said. “It’s a horrible blow to the von Weizsaecker family and the chancellor’s condolences, and certainly also those of all the members of the government, go to the widow, to the entire family.”Christian Lindner, the head of the Free Democrats party, of which Fritz von Weizsaecker was a member, expressed shock at the murder.“I’m stunned and have to share my sadness,” Lindner tweeted. “Once more one wonders what kind of world we live in.”The board of Berlin’s Charite hospital said they were “deeply shocked by the violent death of the highly regarded friend and colleague. Our thoughts are with his family and the colleagues at Schlosspark-Klinik.”Von Weizsaecker studied and worked at several hospitals in Germany and abroad, including the Harvard Medical School in Boston and a hospital in Zurich, Switzerland. His fields of expertise were internal medicine and gastroenterology.On Tuesday night, he was giving a lecture about fatty liver disease, an increasingly common medical condition. The lecture was open to everybody and local media reported that several colleagues were in the audience as well.The slaying of von Weizsaecker echoes a similar incident in 2016 when a man fatally shot a doctor at Berlin’s Benjamin Franklin Hospital before killing himself.The von Weizsaeckers are one of Germany’s most prominent families. Richard von Weizsaecker was not only one of the most popular but also one of the country’s most respected presidents.In 1985, then-West German President von Weizsaecker called the Nazi defeat Germany's \\\"day of liberation\\\" in a speech marking the 40th anniversary of the war's end. His words were supported by most Germans, and to this day the speech is often cited by politicians and taught in schools.__David Rising and Frank Jordans contributed to this story. \" \n",

      "https://news.yahoo.com/chinese-bishop-run-refusing-join-115240747.html\n",
      " \"  A Catholic bishop in China is believed to be on the run from state security after refusing to bring his church under a government-sanctioned religious association.Guo Xijin, 61, has fled the custody of state agents and has gone into hiding, reported Catholic Asia News, a website, and cannot be immediately reached for comment. Mr Guo is part of a group of bishops that many religious and human rights experts feared would be persecuted after the Vatican inked a deal with Beijing last year on the ordaining bishops. China has long insisted that it approve appointments, clashing with absolute papal authority to pick bishops. The agreement broke that standoff, and could help pave the way for formal diplomatic ties, but also stoked worries that the Chinese state would have too much power to regulate religion. Since Communism took hold in China, there have been in practice two Catholic churches - one sanctioned by the government, and an underground one loyal to the Vatican, and it remains unclear what would happen to bishops who refused to fall in line with the government.China’s officially atheist Communist Party – has engaged in a widespread crackdown on religion in the last few years. Authorities have banned Arab-style onion domes on mosques and other buildings – even if merely decorative.The UN estimates more than a million Muslims have been detained in chilling “re-education” camps, where former detainees have told The Telegraph they were subject to physical torture, psychological intimidation and political indoctrination.The government has shut down churches not sanctioned by the Party, detaining priests and members of various congregations. And houses of worship, including Buddhist temples, are now mandated to have pictures of Xi Jinping, the leader of the Party. Chinese authorities claim that people have freedom of religion – provided that they worship in state-sanctioned temples, churches, and mosques. The government has said that all religious believers must “be subordinate to and serve the overall interests of the nation and the Chinese people,” making it explicit that they must also “support the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.”  \" \n",

      "https://news.yahoo.com/india-army-reduce-orders-sniper-093544384.html\n",
      " \" (Bloomberg) -- The Indian Army plans to buy just 1,800 state-of-the-art sniper rifles and 2.7 million rounds of ammunition -- less than a third of its total requirement -- driven by budgetary constraints and the need to speed up deliveries, people with knowledge of the matter said.The military pruned its original requirement of 5,720 sniper rifles and 10 million rounds of ammunition, which would have cost $140 million, to prioritize spending and advance the purchase of more modern equipment, they said, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public.Indian Army spokesman Aman Anand said he had no comment to offer on the change in procurement plans.The Indian armed forces have 450,000 infantry soldiers, of whom only half go into ground battle and an even smaller number of them use sniper rifles to take out specific enemy targets through precision firing.The move is part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s $250-billion modernization plan for the Indian defense forces, as the infantry soldiers continue to face the brunt of deadly attacks in disputed border areas such as Kashmir and the northeast.Plans to buy new equipment from global manufacturers, however, has been hit by bureaucratic delays and the Modi government’s desire to meet the needs of the armed forces through the domestic industry under his ‘Make in India’ initiative, a key plank to boost local defense manufacturing and woo his core supporters.The 1.3 million-strong Indian Army’s previous efforts to buy 5,720 sniper rifles in a process that began in Feb. 2018 was scrapped in July this year after four vendors, including the U.S.-based Barrett, Indonesia’s PT Pindad and Russia’s Rosoboronexport, failed to meet technical requirements, such as technology transfers for manufacturing the ammunition by local industry.Through the new bid to buy a smaller quantity of 8.6 mm sniper rifles and .338 Lapua Magnum ammunition, India wants to overcome the hurdles in first identifying the vendor to buy them in a fast-track mode, before placing future orders for 4,000 more sniper rifles.To contact the reporter on this story: N.

      " \" Washington (AFP) - The US aircraft carrier strike group Abraham Lincoln sailed through the key Strait of Hormuz on Tuesday to show Washington's \\\"commitment\\\" to freedom of navigation, the Pentagon said, amid tensions with Tehran.The group's move through the strategic waterway separating Iran and the United Arab Emirates towards the Gulf was scheduled, and unfolded without incident, the US Navy said in a statement.The strait is a chokepoint for a third of the world's seaborne oil.A Pentagon official who spoke on condition of anonymity said exchanges between US forces and Iran's coast guard were \\\"safe and professional.\\\"It was the first time a US aircraft carrier group went through the strait since Iran downed a US drone in June in the same area.Also in June, two foreign tankers were attacked in the area. Those attacks were blamed on Iran, though it denied involvement.The last time a US aircraft carrier transited the strait was in April, the Pentagon official said.The Strait of Hormuz is particularly vulnerable because it is very narrow -- about 50 kilometers (30 miles) wide -- and not very deep.Iran, which has a sophisticated military and controls much of the oil shipping lanes through the Strait of Hormuz, regularly threatens to shut it down if its enemies, such as the United States, commit hostile acts. \" \n",

      " \" .oembed-frame {width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;border:0;}A 16-year-old boy allegedly tried to smuggle methamphetamine across the U.S.-Mexico border with a remote-controlled car. Border Patrol agents arrested the teen Sunday, according to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection news release Tuesday. The drugs have an estimated value of more than $106,000, the release said.This attempt comes two years after drug traffickers flew a remote-controlled drone to drop a 13-pound package of methamphetamine across the border, also resulting in an arrest. “I am extremely proud of the agents’ heightened vigilance and hard work in stopping this unusual smuggling scheme,\\\" said San Diego Sector Chief Patrol Agent Douglas Harrison. Agents first saw the boy walking along the secondary border wall with two duffel bags shortly after midnight Sunday, the release said. They eventually found the teen, identified as a U.S. citizen, hiding in brush.He had 50 bundles of methamphetamine weighing about 56 pounds, according to the release, along with a remote controlled-car. He is facing drug smuggling charges, authorities said. Double take: South Dakota says, 'Meth. We're On It,' and Twitter asks, Are you guys OK?The 25-year-old man who used a drone to smuggle drugs across the border was sentenced last year to 12 years in prison. Border Patrol officials say such airborne smuggling attempts are only expected to increase as drone technology improves.Smugglers also rely on the U.S. Postal Service to smuggle their highest-profit drugs into the country. A 2018 report from the Postal Service's Inspector General found that drug shipments have been on a steady rise in recent years, with over 40,000 pounds of drugs seized in the mail in 2017.Fact-checking Trump officials: Most drugs enter US through legal ports of entry, not vast, open borderThe report conceded that postal inspectors identify only a fraction of the drugs entering through the U.S. mail. It found 104 drug trafficking websites on the dark web that identified their shipment methods, and 92% indicated that they used the U.S. Postal Service.Contributing: Alan Gomez, USA TODAY This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Border Patrol: Teen used remote-controlled car to smuggle meth \" \n",

      "https://news.yahoo.com/forget-bombs-missiles-irans-intelligence-132000367.html\n",
      " \" Very rarely do any of us on the outside world know with much clarity about what exactly is going on in the world of Iranian intelligence. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Iranian military intelligence, and the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security are notorious for their secrecy and efficiency. General Qassem Soleimani, the long-time director of the IRGC’s Quds Force, is one of the most popular public figures in Iran today and has long been a household name (and a major irritant) for U.S. intelligence officers. For those of us who don’t have access to the classified intelligence, we have often see Soleimani as the Iranian military man with the thin, white beard who travels to war zones in Syria, poses for pictures on the frontlines with his fatigues, and organizes and deploys irregular Shia militias to to bail out Tehran’s strategic allies (like Syria’s Bashar al-Assad) when they are dangerously close to being pushed out of power.A remarkable collaborative project between The Intercept and the New York Times, however, has provided the general public with a little more insight into the Iranian spy-games. Composed of hundreds of reports and cables written within the 2014 and 2015 timeframe and crafted by Iranian intelligence operatives on the ground, the project is a reminder of the proficiency, ruthlessness, cunning, and stone-cold pragmatism of a country frequently described in Washington, D.C. as an emerging 21st century Persian Empire acting solely on emotion and religious fanaticism. While it’s always tricky business to extrapolate from a sample, the reports leaked to the Times and The Intercept point to a nation that is more than willing to push ideology aside in favor of cold-blooded calculation—particularly in next-door Iraq. Three things stand out: 1. Iran has great sources:  Read the original article.  \" \n",

      "Trump impeachment: Four key moments from bombshell Sondland testimony\n",
      "https://news.yahoo.com/trump-impeachment-four-key-moments-193414371.html\n",
      " \" Gordon Sondland may have provided much-needed aid to Republicans defending Donald Trump on Capitol Hill during the House-led impeachment inquiry – had his public testimony occurred last month.Unfortunately for the president and his allies, the ambassador’s memory was conveniently \\\"refreshed\\\" when he submitted a change to his testimony earlier this month and by the time he delivered explosive evidence on Wednesday morning.Whereas Mr Sondland previously testified in October that he was unaware of the administration’s plans to withhold crucial US military assistance to Ukraine while demanding political investigations into one of Mr Trump’s rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden, his story had vastly changed during the fourth day of public impeachment hearings.Mr Sondland held no diplomatic experience when he was appointed by Mr Trump to serve as the US ambassador to the EU, but donated $1m (£774,105) to the president’s 2016 inaugural committee. His new testimony linked top White House and State Department officials to a “quid pro quo” involving US-Ukraine policy — from the very beginning of his opening remarks.Here are four key moments from the ambassador’s damning public testimony:Gordon Sondland directly implicated Donald Trump in Ukraine quid pro quo The ambassador described having to work with Mr Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who he said “was expressing the desires of the president of the United States” when he demanded Ukraine announce investigations into Mr Biden and the origins of the US federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.“We knew that these investigations were important to the president,” Mr Sondland said.Throughout the hearing, Mr Sondland identified Mr Giuliani as the point of contact for the investigations, saying “President Trump was not really interested in engaging, he really wanted Rudy to handle it”.Mike Pompeo approved of plan urging Volodymyr Zelensky to announce probesMr Sondland not only implicated the president in the apparent quid pro quo involving Ukraine, but he said Mr Trump’s top appointees were also involved in working to get public commitments for investigations from Mr Zelensky. The ambassador told investigators he spoke with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about getting the Ukrainian president to commit to investigations during a meeting with Mr Trump.“Everyone was in the loop,” Mr Sondland said. “It was not secret.”Schiff: OTHER SENIOR OFFICIALS IN THE STATE DEPT AND THE CHIEFS OF STAFF'S OFFICE, INCL. MICK MULVANEY, SEC POMPEO, WERE AWARE OF THIS QUID PRO QUO THAT IN ORDER TO GET THE WH MEETING, THERE WERE GOING TO HAVE TO BE THESE INVESTIGATIONS THE PRESIDENT WANTED? Sondland: CORRECT.Republicans turn on Gordon Sondland, calling his testimony a “trifecta of unreliability” The GOP swiftly sought to undermine the ambassador’s testimony, as Steve Castor, the House Republican counsel, described Mr Sondland’s evidence as “the trifecta of unreliability”.“You don’t have records,” the attorney said. “A lot of it is speculation. A lot of it is your guess.”The president’s allies also attempted to push back against the testimony, including US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who said Mr Sondland “misrepresented” his interaction with Mr Giuliani “and direction the secretary received from President Trump”.White House blocking records increasingly becomes an issue in fact-finding process Ironically, one of the Republicans’ main arguments against the testimony delivered by Mr Sondland was that he lacked evidence to support his claims — despite many of those records having been blocked throughout the investigation by none other than the White House.Top officials with first-hand knowledge of the president’s dealings with Ukraine have been ordered not to comply with congressional subpoenas to testify in the investigation, though several have broken ranks with the administration and met with House investigators.Mr Sondland frequently reminded Republicans during their questioning that he could not answer certain questions because he was limited in his ability to review records and transcripts of his phone calls with the president, considering such material has been blocked by the administration. “What I’m trying to do today is to use the limited information” I have, Mr Sondland said.

      "https://news.yahoo.com/1-u-ship-vietnam-boost-085927826.html\n",
      " \" (Adds Esper remarks in paragraph 4, background)By Phil Stewart and James PearsonHANOI, Nov 20 (Reuters) - The United States announced on Wednesday it will provide Vietnam with another coast guard cutter for its growing fleet of ships, boosting Hanoi's ability to patrol the South China Sea amid tensions with China.U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper disclosed the decision during an address in Vietnam, which has emerged as the most vocal opponent in Asia of China's territorial claims in the South China Sea.In his speech, Esper took aim at China, which he accused of \\\"bullying\\\" neighbours, like Vietnam.\\\"China's unilateral efforts to assert illegitimate maritime claims threaten other nations' access to vital natural resources, undermine the stability of regional energy markets, and increase the risk of conflict,\\\" Esper told students at the Diplomatic Academy of Vietnam.The vessel will be Vietnam's second cutter from the U.S. Coast Guard, which just two years ago transferred a Hamilton-class cutter to Vietnam. By providing the ships, the U.S. hopes to enable Vietnam to assert its sovereignty and deter China.More than four decades after the Vietnam War ended, ties between the United States and Vietnam are increasingly focused on shared concerns over Chinese expansion.China claims 90% of the potentially energy-rich South China Sea, but Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also lay claim to parts of it, through which about $3 trillion of trade passes each year.Beijing in July sent a ship for a months-long seismic survey to an area internationally designated as Vietnam’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) but also claimed by China.Vietnam said earlier this month it could explore legal action in the dispute, a move previously taken by the Philippines - where Esper visited earlier this week.In 2016, the Philippines won a ruling from the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague that invalidated China's claim over most of the South China Sea.Speaking earlier at Vietnam's defence ministry, Esper said the international rules-based order “has come under duress.\\\"\\\"Collectively, we must stand up against coercion and intimidation, protect the rights of all nations, big and small,\\\" Esper said.The United States accuses China of militarising the South China Sea and trying to intimidate Asian neighbours who might want to exploit its extensive oil and gas reserves.In April, the United States delivered six patrol boats worth $12 million to Vietnam's Coast Guard. Those vessels were in addition to another twelve \\\"Metal Shark\\\" patrol boats it provided to Vietnam in the last two years.

      "https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-pol-joking-asked-vindman-182500638.html\n",
      " \" During impeachment hearings on Tuesday morning, the lead Republican counsel pressed Lt. Colonel Alexander Vindman on an offer he’d received to take the position of defense minister in Kiev. The line of questioning seemed designed to raise doubts about Vindman’s allegiance to the U.S. right as he was testifying about his concerns over President Donald Trump’s efforts to dig up dirt in Ukraine on his domestic political rivals. But a former top national security official in Ukraine told The Daily Beast that he was “joking” when he offered Vindman the post and never actually had the authority to make such an offer.Oleksander Danylyuk, the former Chairman of the National Security and Defence Council in Ukraine, said he only remembers speaking with Vindman once about the defense minister position. He said it he and Vindman had engaged in a light-hearted conversation about how the two used to live close to one another in the former Soviet Union. It was then that Danylyuk jokingly told Vindman that he should take the defense minister job in Ukraine. “We both smiled and laughed,” Danylyuk said. “It was clearly a joke.” Danylyuk said he wouldn’t have been able to seriously offer Vindman the position without direct sign off from President Volodymyr Zelensky. MSNBC Host: GOP Hinting at Vindman Dual Loyalty ‘Perhaps Inspired’ by Fox NewsRepublican House investigators consistently questioned Vindman during his public hearing about his interactions with Danylyuk, including whether the former Ukrainian national security official offered him the job of defense minister. “Ukraine's a country that's experienced a war with Russia,” said GOP counsel Steve Castor. “Certainly, their Minister of Defense is a pretty key position. For the Ukrainians—President Zelensky, Mr. Danylyuk—to bestow that honor on you, at least asking you, that was a big honor, correct?”Vindman said that Danylyuk had suggested he take the job three times but that he “immediately dismissed” the offers and reported the encounters to his superiors at the National Security Council. Vindman also noted that Danylyuk might have been joking when they spoke about the position.Danylyuk left his post in Ukraine in September. But during his time in the Zelensky administration he worked closely with U.S. officials, including former National Security Advisor John Bolton, on U.S.-Ukraine relations. Danylyuk was present for a July 10 meeting at the White House with Bolton, Vindman and other White House and State Department officials, including U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordan Sondland. He also met with Vice President Pence in Warsaw in August and pushed for the U.S. to quickly release U.S. military aid to the country.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

      "https://news.yahoo.com/ex-girlfriend-seeks-avoid-testifying-170132451.html\n",
      " \" UPPER MARLBORO, Md. (AP) — A California college student wants to be excused from testifying at the murder trial of an ex-boyfriend charged with a hate crime in a black student’s fatal stabbing on the University of Maryland’s campus.Sean Urbanski’s former girlfriend, Kim Stringer, says he mistakenly believes she would testify that Urbanski, a 24-year-old white man, had no racial animus that would motivate him to commit a hate crime. Stringer doesn’t have any relevant testimony that would assist Urbanski’s defense, her attorney, Timothy Maloney, wrote in a court filing last week.In June, Prince George’s County Circuit Court Judge Lawrence Hill Jr. ruled that racist memes found on Urbanski’s cellphone can be used as evidence at his trial over the May 2017 killing of 23-year-old Richard Collins III.The judge didn’t immediately rule on Maloney’s request to quash a subpoena for Stringer to testify next month at Urbanski’s trial in Maryland. The subpoena creates a “great inconvenience” and “significant anxiety” for Stringer, a student at a college in Fresno, California, her lawyer said.“The subpoena to the former girlfriend has been issued for the purpose of harassment, and not for any relevant purpose related to the upcoming trial,” Maloney wrote.Urbanski’s attorneys didn’t immediately respond Tuesday to an email seeking comment.Urbanski is charged with first-degree murder and a hate crime in the killing of Collins, a Bowie State University student who was visiting friends at the University of Maryland's College Park campus when he was stabbed to death at a bus stop.Urbanski's attorneys have argued it would deprive their client of a fair trial if jurors view evidence that he had at least six photographs of racist memes on his phone and that he liked a Facebook page called \\\"Alt-Reich: Nation.\\\" The defense lawyers argued the material is inflammatory, irrelevant and inadmissible, with no connection between the content and the killing.Prosecutors have said the racist content found on Urbanski's cellphone point to a motive for the killing, indicating he stabbed Collins because he was black. One of the racist memes found on Urbanski's phone \\\"advocates violence against blacks,\\\" while another has an image of a noose, a handgun and poison, a prosecutor said.The judge refused to exclude the evidence from a trial scheduled to start Dec. 9.Urbanski is a former University of Maryland student. Collins was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army shortly before his death.Urbanski approached Collins and two of his friends near a bus stop on the College Park campus about 3 a.m., authorities said. Urbanski said, \\\"Step left, step left if you know what's best for you,\\\" and Collins replied, \\\"No,\\\" before Urbanski stabbed him once in the chest, according to charging documents.Defense attorney William Brennan has said witnesses told investigators that Urbanski was extremely drunk and screaming incoherently when he approached the three friends at the bus stop. \" \n",

We actually feared the worst,\\\" he told DW.Bennett said Princess Basmah finally responded to phone calls, but was \\\"sounding very much like a hostage.\\\" It is not clear when Bennett was able to reach the princess.An anonymous source close to the princess told DW: \\\"Princess Basmah could not speak openly because her communications were being monitored.\\\"Fedor Selivanov/ShutterstockBennett says Princess Basmah's flight was due to pass through Turkey, so Saudi authorities were likely suspicious that she was escaping to an enemy of the Saudi state, which Turkey was at the time.A source close to the princess told DW: \\\"They [Saudi authorities] have done an investigation to see if [the allegations of fleeing were] true and now they have finished it, yet up until now there has been no answer.\\\"\\\"It has been proven to be false information but we still don't know why she is being detained.\\\"A friend of Princess Basmah who spoke with DW on condition of anonymity said Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman must know of her whereabouts.\\\"A couple of sources there say they don't think the number one [MBS] knows, but I disagree — he does know.

      " \" Lyon (AFP) - A French court on Tuesday confirmed the two-year suspended jail terms given to Pablo Picasso's former electrician and his wife, who hoarded 271 of the great painter's works in a garage for four decades.The verdict by the Lyon court is the latest twist in a decade-long legal saga, which took the couple, who claim the works were a gift, all the way to France's top appeals court.Pierre and Danielle Le Guennec were first given two-year suspended terms in 2015 after being convicted of possession of stolen goods over the huge trove of works by Picasso, including nine rare Cubist collages and a work from his famous Blue Period.That verdict was upheld in 2016 by a higher court but then quashed by the Cour de Cassation, which ordered a retrial.The former electrician, 80, and his wife, 76, were not in court Tuesday when they were found guilty for a third time.\\\"It is a triumph of truth and marks the end of a cover-up\\\", said Jean-Jacques Neuer, lawyer for Picasso's son Claude Ruiz-Picasso.He accused Pierre Le Guennec of playing for art dealers \\\"the role that drug mules play in drug-trafficking\\\", alleging that rich art dealers had sought to exploit the couple.The Le Guennecs have always denied stealing the works.At his original trial Pierre Le Guennec claimed that Picasso had presented him with the artworks towards the end of his life to reward him for his loyal service.But he later changed his account, telling an appeal court that the works were part of a huge collection that Picasso's widow Jacqueline asked him to conceal after the artist's death in 1973.Le Guennec said he stored more than a dozen garbage bags of unsigned works which Jacqueline later retrieved, except for one bag which she left him saying: \\\"Keep this, it's for you.\\\"The affair came to light when Pierre Le Guennec attempted to get the works authenticated by Claude Ruiz-Picasso in 2010.The artist's heirs promptly filed a complaint against him, triggering an investigation.Commenting on the latest ruling, Neuer said: \\\"If you have 271 works by Picasso and you want to put them on the international market you need a certificate of authenticity.\\\"If you see the Picasso estate and tell them these works fell from the sky or you picked them up from the bric-a-brac market, there is little chance anyone will believe you.\\\" \" \n",

As a Hoosier and an educator, I am proud to stand with our teachers today. It is time to #FundOurFuture and give them a raise! #RedforEdAfter brief remarks on the steps of the Statehouse, demonstrators marched around the Indiana government center carrying signs saying \\\"we expect respect\\\" and \\\"keep great teachers in Indiana.\\\"At least one passerby showed support, holding out of a car window a sign that said, \\\"we support you – parents.\\\"Others honked as they drove by and the crowd cheered \\\"red for ed.\\\"And the Red for Ed March is starting. pic.twitter.com/RxURihMBL0See them all: These Indiana school districts closed for Red for Ed Action DayInside the Statehouse, Indiana State Superintendent of Public Instruction Jennifer McCormick received a standing ovation from teachers seated in chairs on the floor and crowding around the balconies.McCormick, a Republican surrounded by Democrats on stage, surprised many in October 2018 when she announced she would not seek a second term. She will be the last to hold the position, which will be eliminated in favor of a governor-appointed secretary of education in 2021.Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, received a rock star's welcome, with teachers lining up to take selfies with her. And when she took the stage, the crowd erupted. \\\"Teachers want what children need, and we will fight to get it,\\\" Weingarten said, receiving chants of \\\"Randi, Randi, Randi.\\\"“We’re here to send a message to the governor that we won’t put up with it anymore,” said Brett Voorhies, president of the Indiana AFL-CIO.But Gov. Eric Holcomb wasn’t there. He is at the Republican Governor’s Association meeting in Florida. According to Holcomb’s office, the event has been on his schedule since last year. Holcomb is the organization’s public policy chairman.“Today is a great opportunity for educators, families and community members to express their voice at the people’s house,” he said in a statement released Tuesday afternoon. “I remain committed to finding long-term sustainable solutions to increase teacher compensation.”Earlier this year, Holcomb created a commission to study Indiana’s teacher pay problem and look for solutions. It’s expected to make recommendations to the General Assembly ahead of the 2021 budget-writing session.“As we continue to seek systemic improvements, it’s essential we retain and attract great teachers to ensure Hoosier students receive the best education our state can offer,” Holcomb said.Holcomb’s campaign was fundraising off the teacher pay issue Tuesday. The campaign sent a fundraising request email with the subject line: “Governor Holcomb’s Goal: Boosting Teacher Wages.”Red for Ed chants coming from the atrium of the Statehouse briefly interrupted Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma as he began remarks to open the legislature's Organization Day.Bosma, who announced he would not seek another term, spoke about ILEARN as teachers sat in the gallery. The House Speaker touted the state's move to the tests, prompting teachers in the room to shake their heads.Some teachers applauded when Bosma said he wanted to look at decoupling teacher evaluations and assessments from the test.ILEARN replaced the much-maligned ISTEP test last spring.Rhonda Knerr, Theresa Simpson and a handful of other teachers from Edgewood Primary School in Ellettsville waited more than an hour to get through security for the afternoon rally inside the Statehouse where teachers shared their experiences with everything from testing to low pay before Gambill echoed earlier comments calling on lawmakers to “do right by our students or we’ll make it right in November.”Only a fraction of those who gathered outside earlier in the day, though, made it inside. Previous expectations of the main floor filled to capacity with more than 10,000 educators were overblown; the crowd of several thousand packed into one half of the building.Jack Graves, who leads the autism program at James A Garfield School 31, said he’s been teaching for 10 years – and also working at a restaurant for seven of those years to help pay the bills.Working at the restaurant is “my car payment and my fun money,” he said, adding that he stays in education because he thinks it’s important.Tuesday was the first time he’d been at an action day for education. Graves said it was a lot bigger than he expected. For him, attending was about showing support. Graves said he sees how defeated and burnt out his fellow teachers are.“You shouldn’t be that discouraged,” Graves said.Willandra Malone was up at 4 a.m. and made the trip from her home in Edinburgh where she teaches fourth grade. She met at a colleague's house at 6 a.m. and, along with Malone's son, they rode the IndyGo bus to the capitol building. \\\"I'm here to stand up for my students,\\\" Malone said. \\\"My babies, our babies, need more.\\\"More than half of the state’s public school districts closed for the event after thousands of teachers requested the day off to lobby for better pay, among other things.While some districts are having an “e-learning day” for students, most will make up the day later in the school year.Christine Elkin said she and 160 of her colleagues loaded charter buses at 6 a.m. to join the rally. Elkin, a fifth grade teacher, has been in the classroom for 15 years and said the profession needs more educators. \\\"Our class sizes are getting larger and larger each year,\\\" she said, \\\"and we don't feel like we're able to do the best for our kids anymore.\\\"Reigan Blair teaches 7th grade math. She and her co-workers left at 5 a.m. central time to be in Indianapolis for Tuesday's rally.\\\"We don't have the money to support our students, we don't have the money for resources.\\\"She said she's had to pay out of her pocket for supplies – everything from rulers and colored pencils to even copy paper.Blair said she's been teaching for 27 years and has never attended a rally this large. \\\"I'm awestruck.\\\"Zoey Hernandez, 9, was standing outside the Statehouse holding a sign decorated with red rickrack trim, stars and polka dots in the bubble letters that read “You can’t put students first if you put teachers last.”She came to the rally with her mom, Charlotte Hernandez, and older brother Michael.Charlotte Hernandez is a teacher and got the kids up at 5 a.m. to attend the rally.“I hate that the headlining thing is our salary,” she said. “That is important but, for me, what’s most important is that my kids are getting a quality education and that they’re getting the funding they deserve.”For Dori Myers, pay is central. A teacher for 20 years, Myers said she just broke $40,000 last year. She's worked second and third jobs bartending, waiting tables and as a cashier at convenience stores. \\\"We're tired of the disrespect, the low pay,\\\" she said. \\\"Our kids are tested beyond belief. \\\"Our kids need a voice and it has to be us.\\\"She added that she hopes that lawmakers don't think Tuesday is just about teacher pay, but about funding to support students.If even half of those who registered for the event show up, it will be one of the largest Statehouse rallies in recent memory and an unprecedented level of action by the state’s teachers.“We’re energized,” Gambill said. “We’ve been doing everything we can over the years. … Still it doesn’t seem to have registered with folks in the Legislature that this is a serious matter.”Gambill said last-in-the-nation wage growth, average pay that lags regional peers and a prolonged teacher shortage have Indiana at a crisis point. Republican House Speaker Brian Bosma said Monday that teacher pay would probably have to wait until the next budget writing session, in 2021. The state’s latest two-year budget was finalized in May.“We have more than 1 million students in public education,” Gambill said. “They can’t wait for us to get to another budget year, and they deserve better than this.”Follow IndyStar education reporter Arika Herron on Twitter: @ArikaHerronMeteorologist fired for alleged racial slur: Jeremy Kappell sues Rochester city, mayorLawsuit: New Jersey student may get $175K after being poked in the eye with pencilThis article originally appeared on Indianapolis Star: Red for Ed Action Day: Indiana teachers march, public schools close \" \n",

      " \" (Washington D.C.) The Navy has laid the keel for its first new, Flight III DDG 51 surface warfare destroyer armed with improved weapons, advanced sensors and new radar 35-times more sensitive than most current systems, changing attack and defensive options for the surface fleet.Navy Flight III Destroyers have a host of defining new technologies not included in current ships such as more on-board power to accommodate laser weapons, new engines, improved electronics, fast-upgradeable software and a much more powerful radar. The Flight III Destroyers will be able to see and destroy a much wider range of enemy targets at farther distances.The ship, called DDG 125, will be named the the USS Jack H. Lucas; it is the first of many Flight III Destroyers the Navy plans to build.A new software and hardware enabled ship-based radar and fire control system, called Aegis Baseline 10, will drive a new technical ability for the ship to combine air-warfare and ballistic missile defense into a single system. The AN/SPY-6 radar, previously called Air and Missile Defense Radar, is engineered to simultaneously locate and discriminate multiple tracks, Scott Spence, Director for Naval Radar Systems for Integrated Defense Systems, Raytheon, told Warrior.This means that the ship can succeed in more quickly detecting both approaching enemy drones, helicopters and low flying aircraft as well as incoming ballistic missiles. “Having a flexible architecture allows us to adapt to new mission requirements. Identifying enemy aircraft is different than air traffic control,” Spence said.Earlier this year, as part of a final step before formal integration of the radar onto Flight III Destroyers, the Navy conducted a successful intercept test against a ballistic missile target using the SPY 6 v1, a Navy statement said.Service officials say the new ship uses newly integrated hardware and software with common interfaces, something which will enable continued modernization in future years. Called TI 16 (Technical Integration), the added components are engineered to give Aegis Baseline 10 additional flexibility should it integrate new systems such as emerging electronic warfare or laser weapons, according to Navy statements.Read the original article.  \" \n",

      "https://news.yahoo.com/trump-news-live-key-witness-212940274.html\n",
      " \" Gordon Sondland has implicated a number of White House officials who were “in the loop” with Donald Trump's direction to withhold aid to Ukraine in an exchange for a meeting and a public statement announcing an investigation into the president’s political opponents.The testimony came as Democrats were preparing to hold their fifth debate of 2020 in Atlanta, where they will undoubtedly be asked about the freshly sprung impeachment inquiry that has dominated headlines.Mr Sondland, a US ambassador to the EU, affirmed that there was a so-called quid pro quo, dropping a bombshell testimony into another pivotal hearing in the House impeachment inquiry into the president’s alleged abuses of power in his dealings with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky.According to his testimony, Mr Sondland worked under the president’s order to work with Rudy Giuliani “not because we liked it but because it was the only constructive path” to building a relationship with a vulnerable Ukraine. In emails and other conversations with US officials — including Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Energy Secretary Rick Perry — Mr Sondland established a clear link from the president, through Giuliani, and efforts to engage Ukraine with investigations into the 2016 election and Burisma.Please allow a moment for our live blog to loadMr Trump told reporters outside the White House that he barely knows Mr Sondland, who he previously called a \\\"great American\\\", and that he seems like a “nice guy\\\".The president read from a stack of papers in his hand, which included, in capital letters, his recollection of a conversation with Mr Sondland in which Trump said \\\"I WANT NOTHING. I WANT NOTHING. I WANT NO QUID PRO QUO.\\\"White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said that \\\"the US aid to Ukraine flowed, no investigation was launched, and President Trump has met and spoken with President Zelensky. Democrats keep chasing ghosts.\\\"Mr Pence and Mr Perry also released statements during the hearing denying Mr Giuliani’s influence in their dealings with Ukraine. They’ve refused to testify in the impeachment probe.Mr Trump also lashed out at his Democratic opponents conducting the House impeachment inquiry, mocked key witnesses giving testimony for their sartorial choices and denied that the onset of a heart attack was what prompted his sudden trip to hospital on Saturday.\\\"These people are sick. They’re sick. And the press really in this country is dangerous. We don’t have freedom of the press in this country. We have the opposite. We have a very corrupt media,\\\" the president ranted from the Cabinet Room of the White House on Tuesday.The inquiry heard from four witnesses on Tuesday who detailed the administration’s coercion of Ukraine.

      " \" * Hong Kong citizen says he was tortured in China* Britain says Cheng's treatment \\\"amounts to torture\\\"* China questioned Cheng over British involvement in protests* Britain summoned Chinese ambassador (Adds Hong Kong's justice minister)By Guy FaulconbridgeLONDON, Nov 20 (Reuters) - A former employee of Britain's consulate in Hong Kong said Chinese secret police beat him, deprived him of sleep and shackled him in an attempt to force him to give information about activists leading pro-democracy protests.Hong Kong, which was returned to China by Britain in 1997, has been convulsed by sometimes violent protests and mass demonstrations, the biggest political crisis for Beijing since the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.Simon Cheng, a Hong Kong citizen who worked for the British government for almost two years, said he was tortured while detained for 15 days as he returned from a trip to mainland China in August.\\\"I was hung (handcuffed and shackled) on a steep X-Cross doing a spread-eagled pose for hours after hours,\\\" Cheng said in a post on Facebook.\\\"Sometimes, they ordered me to do the 'stress tests', which includes extreme strength exercise such as 'squat' and 'chair pose' for countless hours. They beat me every time I failed to do so using something like sharpened batons.\\\"Britain said Cheng's treatment amounted to torture and summoned China's ambassador to express outrage. China did not immediately comment on Cheng. Reuters was unable to verify his account.In an 8,000 word description of his experiences, Cheng relates a nightmare of repeated physical abuse, threats and questioning about Britain's alleged meddling in the protests.At one point in the interrogation by secret police, he was given a bizarre lecture about astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus whose unpopularity in the 16th Century was used to justify the argument that China was not ready for democracy.Cheng was accused of being a British spy and questioned at length about protest leaders and their links to the London School of Economics. Eventually, it was proposed, he should work for the Chinese \\\"motherland\\\".\\\"I was suspected of being a mastermind and British proxy to incite and organise the protests in Hong Kong,\\\" Cheng said.'TORTURE'Britain said Cheng had been treated disgracefully.\\\"Simon Cheng was a valued member of our team. We were shocked and appalled by the mistreatment he suffered while in Chinese detention, which amounts to torture,\\\" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said.\\\"I summoned the Chinese Ambassador to express our outrage at the brutal and disgraceful treatment of Simon in violation of China’s international obligations,\\\" Raab said.Cheng, who said he supported the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement, said he would not seek judicial redress as he had no faith in the Chinese legal system.Hong Kong's justice secretary said she had no opinion on the torture accusation and Cheng should report the matter to the Chinese authorities.\\\"I prefer to hold my opinion until I have the opportunity to collect and analyse any information that I might have,\\\" said Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng, who shares the same surname as the former consulate employee.Hong Kong was handed over to China by the colony's former ruler Britain in 1997 but enjoys a degree of autonomy under the so-called \\\"one country, two systems\\\" formula.China’s ambassador to London on Monday accused foreign countries including the United States and Britain of interfering in Chinese internal affairs through their reactions to the violent clashes taking place in Hong Kong.Ambassador Liu Xiaoming said Western countries were meddling in Hong Kong's affairs.Cheng was forced to give a written confession for betraying the motherland, a statement of apology and a confession for \\\"soliciting prostitution\\\". He was instructed to sing the Chinese national anthem and recorded doing so.He was told that if he spoke about his experiences he would be spirited out of Hong Kong back to mainland China.\\\"I won’t give up the fight for human rights, peace, freedom and democracy for the rest of my life, no matter the danger, discrimination and retaliation I will face, and no matter how my reputation will be stained, and no matter whether my future would be blacklisted, labelled, and ruined,\\\" Cheng said.

      "https://news.yahoo.com/school-district-rural-colorado-tries-093105429.html\n",
      " \" As rural communities across the country struggle to recruit and retain teachers, one school district in a small Colorado town is trying new tactics to attract educators. The Big Sandy School District in Simla invited undergrads from the University of Colorado into their classrooms, hoping to inspire the aspiring teachers to work in a similar setting some day, CBS News correspondent Jericka Duncan reports.Simla is a ranching community about 50 miles from Colorado Springs, where the university is. The Big Sandy School District has 335 students from grades pre-K to 12th grade who learn under one roof.\\\"When you bring in prospective teachers to your school, what are they telling you they need?\\\" Duncan asked.\\\"Salary was a big thing, key thing. And that gets brought up every year at the state level,\\\" Superintendent Steve Wilson said. In Colorado, rural teachers are among the lowest paid in any state.\\\"Also ... there's just a whole bunch more being dumped on educators than used to be. It's not as respected as much,\\\" Wilson said. \\\"It's just a tougher ... profession than it used to be.\\\"Fifteen years ago, Wilson said there were about 30 candidates for every job opening. But, in the last few years, some postings have attracted zero applicants.\\\"Our high school principal ... she happened to be at a restaurant and the waitress said that she was trying to become a teacher through an alternative licensure program,\\\" Wilson said. They hired her and helped expedite that process, he said.The teachers-in-training visited some of the classrooms, including Holly Koehn's kindergarten class.\\\"What do you see as some of the major problems facing rural school districts?\\\" Duncan asked Koehn.\\\"Affordable housing is probably the number one,\\\" she said. \\\"You know, we do live farther out, so the prices of things are higher. You know, you go to the grocery store in a small community, you're going to pay a higher price than you would at a King Soopers.\\\"The 26-year-old said she struggles to pay student loans and make ends meet on her $35,000 a year teaching salary. To cut the costs, last year, she lived in a camper in a field outside of school.\\\"What kept you going while you were living in that trailer?\\\" Duncan asked.\\\"Just coming to school every day and seeing the children and just making bonds with them,\\\" Koehn said.Mary Bauer, another teacher, said the job \\\"has to be something you truly love.\\\" She chose to come back to the school district in 2018 after leaving in 2013 to be close to her husband and their home near Denver, about 90 miles away. She now stays with her sister in Simla during the week.Bauer returned to teach Spanish after the district failed to find a qualified teacher. \\\"They lost their Spanish teacher right at the beginning of the school year and tried online, and it was pretty difficult for them,\\\" she said.\\\"A lot of the kids had to go back and repeat the year that they lost,\\\" she said. \\\"They were that far behind.\\\"But coaxing former teachers and retirees back into the classroom is a Band-Aid solution.\\\"You're expecting upwards of eight to 10 teachers to retire in the next five years. What do you do then?\\\" Duncan asked Wilson.\\\"Yeah, that's a tough thing,\\\" he said. \\\"Some schools are in that boat right now, and ... I think we're shortchanging our students.\\\"Wilson hopes that some of the college students who visited return as teachers. He asked them during their visit if they are interested in working at a rural school in the future.All of them raised their hands.Wilson asked them what changed their mind. One student said, \\\"Everyone's kind of in it together, and I really like that aspect.\\\"\\\"I went to a high school where I graduated with 300 people, and to think that this school has 300 kids from preschool to 12th grade just, like, blows my mind because everybody knows each other,\\\" another said. \\\"And just to think that you could, like, work in a school with that kind of community, that bond, I just, I want to be a part of it.\\\"Day 3, Part 10: Tim Morrison's opening statementDay 3, Part 9: Adam Schiff's and Devin Nunes' afternoon opening statementsMass shootings affected two lawmakers.

      "https://news.yahoo.com/expelled-lsu-student-sentenced-five-192100905.html\n",
      " \" The former Louisiana State University student who was found guilty of negligent homicide for the hazing death of 18-year-old Phi Delta Theta pledge Max Gruver was sentenced to five years in prison on Wednesday.Jurors reportedly took just one hour to convict Matthew Naquin in July. The 21-year-old Texas native was also sentenced to three years of probation and 1,000 hours of community service. The judge ordered Naquin to write a letter of apology to the Gruver family, and for every year he is on probation he must go to three separate high schools and give a one-hour talk about hazing, according to WVLA-TV.He was expelled from LSU in the weeks following Gruver’s death.Gruver died of alcohol poisoning and aspiration—choking on his own vomit—after a hazing ritual called “Bible Study” at the fraternity house on Sept. 13, 2017. During the ritual, prosecutors said Naquin and other fraternity members ordered pledges to stand in a dark hallway facing a wall while loud music played; they were told to chug 190-proof liquor if they could not correctly answer questions about Phi Delta Theta, The Advocate reported.Witnesses reportedly testified during the trial that Naquin, whom authorities have said was a ringleader of the hazing ritual, targeted Gruver that night because he didn’t want him to join the fraternity. Just two days before Gruver’s death, fraternity brothers said they warned Naquin to tone down his extreme and dangerous interactions with pledges, according to court documents and testimony during the trial.When he died, Gruver’s blood-alcohol level was 0.495 percent—more than six times the state’s legal limit to drive, according to the local newspaper. Another pledge had testified during trial that he believed Gruver “had not had much experience with drinking.” A toxicology expert said on the stand that Gruver’s high blood-alcohol concentration led to “sleep, coma and death.” “There was no way his body could get through this,” said the expert, Patricia Williams. “He was a dead man walking at midnight.”Naquin’s attorney, John McLindon, argued during the trial that he was unfairly singled out by the prosecution and that Gruver continued to drink on his own after the hazing event.“It was a hazing event, but there were probably 10 other active members up there that night and at least five of them were handing out alcohol,” McLindon told The New York Times. “Matthew didn’t do anything differently from those boys, but he got picked out because he is very loud.”But East Baton Rouge District Attorney Hillar Moore III countered, in a separate interview with The Times, that Naquin “stood out” through the ferocity with which he tormented pledges that night.“Everyone kept saying he was the one who led everything, who made people drink more, who asked questions,” Moore said. “This is grain alcohol—this is 180-proof or 190-proof alcohol. It is what they put tissue samples in to study them in a lab, when you have to wear a hood.”Moore added: “We have never alleged that the defendant wanted him dead or wanted to kill him, but his actions led to this young man’s death.”Naquin has been separately charged with obstruction of justice after federal agents say he deleted nearly 700 files from his phone minutes after he learned from his attorney that a search warrant had been issued for his device. The FBI never successfully recovered the files. He has not been tried yet on that charge.After the trial, Max’s mother, Rae Ann Gruver, called the guilty verdict “justice for our son and for the man who caused his death.” Gruver was from Roswell, a suburb of Atlanta.“We want this to send a message to the country that hazing should not exist,” Stephen Gruver, Max's father, told The Advocate after the conviction. “It’s dangerous and we have to all work together to bring an end to hazing.”Three other fraternity brothers face misdemeanor hazing charges in the case, two of which have pleaded no contest. Phi Delta Theta has been banned from LSU’s campus until 2033. The school also reportedly convened a task force to study Greek life on campus in the aftermath of Gruver’s death.“Hazing is an irresponsible and dangerous activity that we do not tolerate at LSU,” a spokesman for the school said after the trial. “These tragedies, and the penalties that follow, can be prevented, and we have been working diligently to put more safeguards, education and reporting outlets in place for our students regarding hazing.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

      "https://news.yahoo.com/israel-lurches-towards-third-election-184720060.html\n",
      " \"  Israel lurched closer to an unprecedented third election in one year on Wednesday as Benjamin Netanyahu's centrist challenger admitted that he had failed to form a government.Both Mr Netanyahu and Benny Gantz, the former general who heads the centrist Blue & White party, have now tried and failed to form governments - pushing Israel into an ever deeper political crisis. For the first time in Israeli history, neither of the major parties have succeeded in putting together a governing coalition. The country now enters an unusual 21-day period where any of Israel’s 120 MPs, including Mr Gantz or Mr Netanyahu, can become prime minister if they can show they have the support of a majority of their colleagues. If no clear winner emerges by December 11, Israel will plunge into its third election in 12 months. Aides to both Mr Gantz and Mr Netanyahu said they believed that was the likeliest outcome. Both party leaders said they were in favour of a national national government between Mr Gantz’s Blue & White and Mr Netanyahu’s Likud. But the two sides were never able to reach an agreement on what that unity government would look like. In a scorching speech, Mr Gantz accused the prime minister of continuing the political crisis to shield himself from the criminal corruption charges he is facing. “You are leading us to a dangerous collision that will exert a historic price,” Mr Gantz warned. Prosecutors are expected to bring a formal indictment on corruption charges against Mr Netanyahu next week. He denies any wrongdoing. Mr Netanyahu insisted during negotiations that his Right-wing allies be part of any coalition government, a demand that Blue & White said was unacceptable. The two sides also discussed an arrangement in which Mr Gantz and Mr Netanyahu would rotate as prime minister but could not agree who would go first. Meanwhile, More than 20 Iranian and Syrian regime fighters were reportedly killed in a wave of Israeli airstrikes in and around Damascus on Wednesday, marking the bloodiest Israeli raid in Syria in months. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 16 foreign fighters, including Iranian soldiers, were killed during the attack along with seven Syrian regime troops. Two civilians were also reportedly killed. \" \n",

      "https://news.yahoo.com/literature-nobel-winner-handke-defends-support-serbs-161638162.html\n",
      " \" Berlin (AFP) - Austrian Nobel literature prize winner Peter Handke on Wednesday defended his vocal support for Serbs in the 1990s wars in the former Yugoslavia, but said he \\\"never bowed down\\\" before Slobodan Milosevic.The Swedish academy's pick last month triggered outrage in the Balkans and beyond because of Handke's admiration for the late Serbian strongman.As well as for his literary works, Handke was widely criticised for speaking at the 2006 funeral of Milosevic, who died awaiting trial for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.Speaking to German weekly Die Zeit, Handke said \\\"of course\\\" he had to be at Milosevic's funeral in 2006.\\\"He voted against dissolving Yugoslavia in one of the last ballots. His funeral was Yugoslavia's funeral too,\\\" Handke said. \\\"Have people forgotten that this state was founded in opposition to Hitler's Reich?\\\"At the same time, Handke said he \\\"not once bowed down before him -- not internally, not externally.\\\"One journalist wrote \\\"that I supposedly expressed sympathy for Milosevic. Never!\\\" the author told Die Zeit.The writer was just as unapologetic about his texts, even though he has been accused of minimising Serb war crimes in his 1997 book \\\"A Journey to the Rivers: Justice for Serbia\\\".\\\"Not one word I have written about Yugoslavia can be denounced, not a single one. It's literature,\\\" he said.Back then, \\\"reporting about Serbia was monotone and one-sided,\\\" Handke told Die Zeit.\\\"It was about justice for Serbia. How could Germany recognise Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia-Herzegovina when around a third of people on the territory were Orthodox or Muslim Serbs?\\\" Handke said.\\\"(Serbs) should suddenly be an inferior people in their own country? That had to cause a war,\\\" he added.\\\"Why does no one say the West is responsible, why was a peace conference not called immediately?\\\"Earlier this month, Bosnian women from Srebrenica -- site of the worst massacre during Yugoslavia's bloody collapse -- protested in the capital Sarajevo against Handke's Nobel award.They said they would return to Stockholm's embassy each week until the prize is presented on December 10.Some 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered at Srebrenica by Bosnian Serb forces in July 1995.The women from the town held up pictures of Handke they said were taken on a visit he made to the hamlet less than a year after the killings.\\\"The Nobel prize for Handke is a vote in support of our humiliation\\\" by genocide deniers, they wrote in a letter to the Swedish king and queen that they handed to the country's ambassador. \" \n",

      " \" (Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our Next Africa newsletter and follow Bloomberg Africa on TwitterSouth Africa’s government ruled out an intervention in the ongoing battle between the struggling state airline and unions leading a strike, with Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan refusing to step in to fund wage demands.The state has already given South African Airways more than 20.5 billion rand ($1.4 billion) over the past three years, Gordhan said in an emailed statement on Tuesday. The country is facing severe fiscal constraints and no more aid can be made available, he said.Two labor unions representing more than 3,000 staff at SAA walked out Friday in protest at the airline’s plan to cut jobs and refusal to meet demands for an 8% wage increase. The carrier, which has offered a raise of 5.9%, has halted a number of flights and warned that the viability of the entire business is being placed at risk.“The pattern of bailouts has become a moral hazard,” said Gordhan, who met with the unions in Pretoria. “A restructuring of SAA’s business is required to return the airline to profitability. In addition to growing revenues, efficiencies must be improved and costs will need to be reduced across the board.”The minister ended a labor dispute at state power utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd. in 2018 that interrupted the nation’s power supply. He indicated that he won’t do the same to resolve the SAA impasse, saying negotiations are being handled by its management team.Unions should work with SAA to find a speedy resolution to the labor action, which has grounded flights and is worsening the carrier’s already precarious financial position, Gordhan said.Talks aimed at breaking the deadlock ended late Tuesday night without a resolution being reached, according to the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa.Latest strike update from SAA:All international and some regional flights are back in operation, while domestic services are being provided by the SAA’s low-cost unit Mango Airlines SOC Ltd. and partner carriers Safair Operations (Pty) Ltd. and SA Express.All operations are compliant with safety standards.A growing number of employees don’t support the strike and are returning to work.SAA has approached the labor court to interdict unions from making additional demands that are not part of the current dispute.(Updates with outcome of latest talks in penultimate paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Mike Cohen in Cape Town at mcohen21@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Paul Richardson at pmrichardson@bloomberg.net, John Bowker, John ViljoenFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P. \" \n",

      " \" Key point: America is considering what new ships are needed to successfully land troops during a war.The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps are considering acquiring small transport ships in order to complement existing large amphibious vessels and give the fleet more ways of landing troops during a major war.The new small transports, perhaps based on the oil and gas industry’s typical offshore support vessel, could represent a revival of a defunct class of warship that once filled a variety of roles in the American fleet.“As the Navy and the Marine Corps narrow in on what their future amphibious operations might look like, they are considering acquiring something akin to an offshore support vessel to help Marines distribute around a littoral environment in a future fight,” Megan Eckstein wrote for the news website of the U.S. Naval Institute. New commandant of the Marine Corps Gen. David Berger turned heads when his Commandant’s Planning Guidance said “the global options for amphibs include many more options than simply LHAs, LPDs and LSDs” and that, on account of a growing anti-access/area-denial threat environment, “visions of a massed naval armada nine nautical miles off-shore in the South China Sea preparing to launch the landing force in swarms of ACVs, LCUs and LCACs are impractical and unreasonable.”LHA, LPD and LSD are Navy designations for large, armored amphibious assault ships that can displace up to 40,000 tons of water and carry hundreds of Marines plus aircraft, LCAC hovercraft, LCU landing craft and ACV amphibious vehicles. A single large amphib can cost more than a billion dollars.“Since the document was released in July [2019], those in the military and industry have speculated what that could mean,” Eckstein added. The deputy director of expeditionary warfare on the chief of naval operations’ staff (OPNAV N95B) said the commandant’s guidance lines up with what the Navy was already considering: offshore support vessels.Read the original article.  \" \n",

      "https://news.yahoo.com/ukrainian-gas-executive-cooperating-us-224956381.html\n",
      " \" WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal prosecutors are planning to interview an executive with Ukraine’s state-owned gas company as part of an ongoing probe into the business dealings of Rudy Giuliani and two of his Soviet-born business associates.A lawyer for Andrew Favorov confirmed Tuesday that he is scheduled to meet voluntarily with the U.S. Justice Department. Favorov is the director of the integrated gas division at Naftogaz, the state-owned gas provider in Ukraine.Federal prosecutors in New York are investigating the business dealings of Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, including whether he failed to register as a foreign agent, according to people familiar with the probe. The people were not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.Giuliani’s close associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were arrested last month at an airport outside Washington while trying to board a flight to Europe with one-way tickets. They were later indicted by federal prosecutors on charges of conspiracy, making false statements and falsification of records. How to stay updated on USA TODAY's impeachment coverage How to stay updated on USA TODAY's impeachment coverageFollowing an inquiry from The Associated Press, Favorov lawyer Lanny Breuer confirmed his client is set to meet with prosecutors.“The Department of Justice has requested an interview,” Breuer said. “He has agreed and will voluntarily sit down with the government attorneys. At this time, it would not be appropriate to comment further.”Breuer declined to say when or where Favorov, who has dual Ukrainian-U.S. citizenship, will be meeting with prosecutors.Jim Margolin, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of New York, declined to comment.According to a federal indictment filed last month, Parnas and Fruman are alleged to have been key players in Giuliani’s efforts earlier this year to spur the Ukrainian government to launch an investigation of Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden and his son Hunter.The two men’s efforts included helping to arrange a January meeting in New York between Giuliani and Ukraine’s former top prosecutor, Yuri Lutsenko, as well as other meetings with top government officials.While the House impeachment hearings have focused narrowly on Giuliani’s role in pursuing Ukrainian investigations into Democrats, the interest of federal prosecutors in interviewing Favorov suggests they are conducting a broader probe into the business dealings of Giuliani and his associates.The Associated Press reported on Oct. 7 that while they were working with Giuliani to push for investigating the Bidens, Parnas and Fruman were also leveraging political connections to Trump and other prominent Republicans as part of an effort to enrich themselves.In March, Parnas and Fruman approached Favorov while the Ukrainian executive was attending an energy industry conference in Texas. Over drinks and dinner, Giuliani’s associates told him they had flown in from Florida on a private jet to recruit him to be their partner in a new venture to export up to 100 tanker shipments a year of U.S. liquefied gas into Ukraine, where Naftogaz is the largest distributor, according to two people Favorov later briefed on the details.As part of the plan, Parnas suggested backing Favorov to replace his boss, Naftogaz CEO Andriy Kobolyev. Parnas is reported to have also told Favorov that Trump planned to remove the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, and replace her with someone more open to aiding their business interests. Yovanovitch was recalled to Washington in May.Giuliani, who has described Parnas and Fruman as his clients, has denied involvement in the two men’s efforts to forge a gas deal in Ukraine.This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Ukrainian gas executive cooperating in US probe of Giuliani \" \n",

      "https://news.yahoo.com/trump-considering-withdrawing-4-000-231441845.html\n",
      " \" By Joyce LeeSEOUL (Reuters) - The United States is considering a significant cut to its troop numbers in South Korea if Seoul does not contribute more to the cost of the deployment, South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo reported on Thursday.Washington broke off defense cost talks with South Korea this week after demanding Seoul raise its annual contribution to $5 billion, more than five times what it pays now, in a rare public display of discord in the alliance.Neither side has publicly confirmed the numbers, but U.S. President Donald Trump has said the U.S. military presence in and around South Korea was \\\"$5 billion worth of protection\\\".\\\"I understand that the U.S. is preparing to withdraw one brigade in case negotiations with South Korea do not go as well as President Trump wants,\\\" a diplomatic source in Washington with knowledge of the negotiations was cited as saying by Chosun Ilbo.A typical U.S. military brigade numbers about 3,000 to 4,000 troops. There are about 28,500 U.S. troops currently stationed in South Korea, which remains technically in a state of war with nuclear-armed neighbor North Korea following their 1950-1953 conflict.U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said he was not aware of any plans to withdraw 4,000 U.S. troops from South Korea if cost-sharing talks failed.\\\"We're not threatening allies over this. This is a negotiation,\\\" he told reporters during a trip to Vietnam.South Korea's defense ministry said the Chosun report was \\\"not the official position of the U.S. government\\\".Under U.S. law, the United States' troop presence in South Korea must not fall below 22,000 unless the Secretary of Defense justifies a further reduction to Congress.Chosun said the potential reduction of a brigade from U.S. troops stationed in South Korea had already been discussed with the top brass of U.S. forces in South Korea.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.U.S. Special Representative for North Korea Stephen Biegun said on Wednesday he believed the United States should continue to station troops in South Korea, when asked if he would continue to advocate for the presence of U.S. military personnel in the country if he is confirmed as deputy secretary of state.\\\"South Korea is among our most important alliance partners. That doesn't mean anybody gets a free ride. We have a tough burden-sharing negotiation that we're in the middle of with the South Koreans,\\\" Biegun said.South Korean political party leaders visited Washington on Wednesday to press for a fair and reasonable outcome of the cost-sharing talks.\\\"I stressed that a withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea should not be brought up, as the South Korea-U.S. alliance also helps the U.S. national interest,\\\" said Na Kyung-won of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party.Meanwhile, South Korea's intelligence-sharing pact with Japan, which Seoul decided to terminate after relations soured over historical issues and has become the subject of increasing U.S. pressure to renew, is set to expire on Nov. 23.South Korea's presidential office is holding a National Security Council meeting on Thursday, where the agreement is expected to be discussed, South Korean media said.(Reporting by Joyce Lee; Additional reporting by Phil Stewart in Hanoi, David Brunnstrom and Daphne Psaledakis in Washington; Editing by Jack Kim and Stephen Coates) \" \n",

      "https://news.yahoo.com/north-carolina-county-removes-confederate-120130247.html\n",
      " \" PITTSBORO, N.C. (AP) — A North Carolina county removed a Confederate statue from a historic courthouse early Wednesday, joining the handful of places around the state where such monuments have come down in recent years despite a law protecting them.Preparations began Tuesday night to carefully dismantle the statue of a soldier outside the historic Chatham County courthouse, where it had stood since 1907, and continued for hours overnight, said county spokeswoman Kara Lusk Dudley. By dawn, even the base was gone.A subdued crowd of several dozen people watched the work unfold. Television news footage showed workers atop motorized lifts secure the statue, which was then hoisted away by a crane as a few people cheered.The removal comes months after Winston-Salem officials removed a Confederate statue from land there that had passed into private hands. Protesters have also torn down two such monuments in recent years, including one at a historic Durham courthouse and another on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.It has been rare for public officials to take down Confederate statues in North Carolina since the enactment of a 2015 state historic monuments law restricting the removal of public monuments.But county officials argued in court that the monument was private property, owned by the United Daughters of the Confederacy, and a judge hearing the group’s challenge declined to block the removal.Crews closed two highways that intersect at a traffic circle around the courthouse while they dismantled the statue, which stood about 27-feet (8-meters) high outside the courthouse’s front doors.A University of North Carolina catalog of monuments says the statue depicts an anonymous soldier holding a rifle with its butt resting on the ground. It was made of stamped copper, finished to resemble bronze, atop a pedestal of granite.A county news release said the statue and pedestal were carefully dismantled and taken to a safe location until the United Daughters of the Confederacy comes up with a plan for what to do with them.In past weeks, demonstrators for and against removal had gathered around the statue, leading to scuffles and some arrests.“The last several months have been a painful time for Chatham County. We’ve experienced high emotions, division and even violence which have impacted residents, businesses and the overall feel of our community,” Chatham County Board of Commissioners Chair Mike Dasher said in a statement. “What's clear now is that the overwhelming majority of our residents are eager to move forward.”North Carolina has been at the center of the debate over what to do with Confederate monuments as one of three southern states with the most statues, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.More than 90 Confederate monuments stand in public places other than cemeteries around the state. A state tally shows Confederate monuments are located at contemporary or historic courthouses in about half of the state's counties.Onlookers to the Pittsboro removal Wednesday had mixed opinions.“It’s heartbreaking,” Robert Butler, a supporter of the monument, told WRAL-TV. “A statue’s never hurt a soul, just like a grave memorial. Do they hurt anybody?”But Sandra Day of Moncure, who is black, told The News & Observer that she supported its removal. She said she got out of bed and put on a heavy coat to come to Pittsboro to watch the statue come down.“It’s an honor and a privilege to be standing here,” she said. “I wanted to see it for myself.” \" \n",

      "https://news.yahoo.com/jussie-smollett-files-suit-against-175631076.html\n",
      " \" Jussie Smollett filed a countersuit on Tuesday in response to a lawsuit brought by the city of Chicago, alleging the city engaged in “malicious prosecution” that caused the actor “humiliation, mental anguish and extreme emotional distress,” the Chicago Sun Times reported Monday.Smollett was alleged to have staged a racist, homophobic crime against himself in January with the help of two friends, who themselves are brothers of Nigerian origin.A grand jury indicted Smollett in March, but Cook County State Attorney Kim Foxx dropped the charges against the actor, citing the technically victimless nature of the hoax and his record of service to the community.The city of Chicago had filed a lawsuit against Smollett attempting to recover $130,106 from the Empire actor after investigating the staged crime. Smollett’s lawyers assert in the counterclaim that because he has already paid $10,000 to the city “as payment in full in connection with the dismissal of the charges against him” he should be exempt from any further penalties.The counterclaim also alleges the two brothers made “false, self-serving, and unreliable statements” that the police nevertheless used “in order to close the investigation into the attack on Mr. Smollett.”Foxx, who is running for reelection, admitted in a campaign video on Tuesday that she mishandled Smollett’s case. In June the state appointed a special prosecutor to look into her actions regarding the case.After Foxx dropped charges against Smollett, an anonymous prosecutor in her office slammed her handling of the affair.“This case was handled markedly different from any other case at 26th Street,” the prosecutor wrote. “No one knows why, and more importantly, no one can explain why our boss, the head prosecutor of all of Cook County, has decided to so demean and debase both our hard work, and our already tenuous relationship with the Chicago Police Department.” \" \n",

      " \"  Senior Islamic State members with access to “huge” amounts of money are in Turkey and plotting a comeback, an Iraqi spy chief has warned.Lieutenant General Saad al-Allaq, head of Iraq’s Military Intelligence, claimed in an interview with CNN that Iraq has given Ankara dossiers on nine alleged leaders of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil), including top financiers for the terror group.The general said senior Isil figures known as \\\"emirs\\\" have access to vast reserves of cash and were forming new cells in Turkey.He claimed many of them had managed to escape from Isil’s final patch of territory in Baghouz, eastern Syria, after bribing Western-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to reach Idlib in the north-west. From there, he said, they crossed the border to Gaziantep in southern Turkey.\\\"Some of its important leadership fled north, I mean in the direction of neighbouring countries and into border areas like Gazientep,\\\" Lt. Gen. Allaq said.\\\"They have secretly crossed into these areas from the Syrian-Turkish border - top leaders who have money. They crossed with the help of smugglers by paying large amount of money and have secretly entered Turkish territory.\\\"He added: \\\"Those elements who are right now in Turkey play a key role in the recruitment of fighters and terrorists.\\\"CNN was shown Iraq’s arrest warrants for the nine men, who are described as bomb makers.Lt. Gen. Allaq said the men were \\\"among the best bomb makers that Isis ever had.\\\"Lt. Gen. Allaq, who rarely gives interviews, said Iraq had intelligence that Isil leaders were planning jailbreaks of its supporters held in prisons and camps across Syria and Iraq.Turkey told the US network they were looking into the allegations.He said a new Isil mission code-named \\\"Break Down the Fences\\\" intended to storm jails where their followers were being held and try to replenish its manpower.Several high-profile Isil figures and their family members have been discovered in recent weeks in or near Turkey.Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the group’s leader, was found hiding three miles from the border of Turkey in the Syria village of Barisha in Idlib, where he was killed in a US raid on October 26.Abu Hassan al-Muhajir, Isil’s spokesman, was killed the following day several miles away near the town of Jarablus, which is under Turkish administration.Turkey then announced arrests it had made of Baghdadi’s relatives, who had apparently been hiding in the country. \" \n",

      " \" Mexico City (AFP) - Mexico's government said Wednesday it has helped 10 Mexican citizens file lawsuits against Walmart over an August shooting at a store in El Paso, Texas, where a suspected white nationalist killed 22 people.\\\"The objective of these suits, presented in El Paso county, is to hold the company responsible for not taking reasonable and necessary measures to protect its clients from the attack,\\\" the foreign ministry said in a statement.\\\"The plaintiffs are seeking not only justice for themselves, but security for the general public.\\\"The suits were brought by survivors of the attack, their relatives and families of the victims, the foreign ministry said.Eight Mexicans were killed and eight wounded in the August 3 attack in El Paso, a city on the US-Mexican border where 83 percent of the population is Latino.The alleged shooter, Patrick Wood Crusius, 21, reportedly told police he was trying to kill as many Mexicans as possible.He posted a manifesto online before the attack denouncing a \\\"Hispanic invasion\\\" of Texas.Crusius pleaded not guilty last month. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.Mexico has condemned the shooting as a \\\"terrorist attack.\\\"Walmart said in September it would stop selling ammunition for handguns and some military-style rifles at its stores, calling the status quo on firearms in the United States \\\"unacceptable.\\\"The US-based retail giant also said it would bar customers from carrying firearms in its stores.A new shooting in an Oklahoma Walmart left three people dead Monday, including the suspected gunman. Another Walmart shooting in July killed two employees. \" \n",

      "Ohio abortion law would require doctors to attempt impossible procedure of re-implanting ectopic pregnancies in uterus\n",
      "https://news.yahoo.com/ohio-abortion-law-require-doctors-235516403.html\n",
      " \" Anti-abortion politicians in Ohio want doctors to attempt to re-implant ectopic pregnancies – a procedure derided by one doctor as “pure science fiction”.Members of the state’s Republican Party proposed a law this month that would force physicians to attempt an operation for which experts say technology does not currently exist.An ectopic pregnancy is one in which a fertilised egg implants somewhere other than a woman’s uterus, which in most cases ends up being inside a fallopian tube. The situation can be fatal if left untreated.Experts say re-implanting an ectopic pregnancy cannot currently be done. Addressing John Becker, a co-sponsor of the HB413 bill who earlier this year proposed a similar rule, Dr Daniel Grossman said: “We just don’t have the technology. So I would suggest removing this from your bill, since it’s pure science fiction.”The academic added in a Twitter thread in May: “Unfortunately, ectopic pregnancies cannot continue to a live birth. If untreated, as a pregnancy grows, the Fallopian tube (where 96% of ectopics develop) gets stretched to the point of rupture & can cause massive bleeding. 4% of maternal deaths are related to ectopic pregnancy.”The American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists says on its website: “An ectopic pregnancy cannot move or be moved to the uterus, so it always requires treatment.”Ohio’s HB413 would also completely outlaw performing or having an abortion in Ohio, introducing an offence called “abortion murder” and potentially conferring the death penalty on offenders. It categorises an embryo as an “unborn human” from the point of fertilisation. A woman may avoid prosecution if she claims she was forced to terminate her pregnancy and files a police report, the text says.Doctors may not be charged if they terminate a pregnancy in the course of surgery in cases where “it is highly probable that the pregnant woman will die from a certain fatal condition before her unborn child is viable”, it adds. But they must take “all possible steps to preserve” the foetus and the life of the woman, including trying to re-implant an ectopic pregnancy into her womb.It is the latest in a string of laws in several states designed to force a showdown with the Supreme Court, which anti-abortion activists hope will one day overwrite its historic Roe vs Wade ruling that said women should be free to seek a termination.In April a district judge struck down as unconstitutional so-called heartbeat law that had been passed in Ohio and signed by the governor Mike DeWine. Its proponents admitted it had been crafted to form “the next incremental step in our strategy to overturn” the landmark Roe decision.HB413’s objective of totally outlawing terminations “has been the goal of the grassroots of the pro-life movement since” the 1973 ruling, said Margie Christie of the conservative Christian Right to Live Action Coalition of Ohio.Right-wing Christian supporters form a key part of Donald Trump’s voter base. He recently claimed that the evangelical bloc “has never been so energised as it is right now” because of the impeachment investigation into his dealings with Ukraine.Mike Pence and Mike Pompeo, the vice president and secretary of state, are committed believers. Alex Azar, the secretary of health and human services, has boasted of the administration’s anti-abortion stance and called his department “the department of life”. For his part, Mr Trump has backed annual “march for life” protests against terminations.The proposals contained in HB413 could “place individuals experiencing a miscarriage at risk of criminal prosecution”, according to pro-choice activists. ​Kellie Copeland​, of NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio, added in a statement: “If all of that weren’t bad enough, these politicians don’t care that these kinds of bans could also ban some contraceptives and fertility treatments.” Planned Parenthood wins $2m lawsuit against anti-abortion group  \" \n",

      "https://news.yahoo.com/navy-killer-china-dangerous-anti-060000877.html\n",
      " \" A Chinese magazine might have revealed a new and potentially powerful anti-ship and land-attack missile, Roland Oliphant reported for The Telegraph.A centerfold graphic in a recent issue of Modern Ships, a government-produced magazine, depicts the Chinese air force’s new H-6N bomber carrying a previously unknown large missile under its belly, according to Oliphant.The computer-generated image could represent the public’s first glimpse of the CH-AS-X-13, an air-launched variant of the DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile.The Chinese air force has modified a small number of H-6s apparently to carry the new missile, which could pose a serious danger to U.S. Navy vessels and other forces operating in the western Pacific. Aircraft carriers, in particular, could be at risk.The new H-6N variant of the venerable Chinese bomber first appeared over Beijing during preparations for celebrations marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China. Military parades and fly-overs took place on Oct. 1, 2019.The H-6Ns feature an under-fuselage recess that could accommodate a single, very large missile. The DF-21D is more than 30 feet long and weighs around 32,000 pounds. It can travel as far as 1,300 miles with a 1,200-pound warhead.“Experts say that there at least four of these aircraft presently assigned to a People's Liberation Army Air Force bomber brigade in China's Central Theater Command region,” Joseph Trevithick wrote at The War Zone. Reports about the H-6N and its ballistic-missile launching mission first began to emerge in 2017. Xi'an Aircraft International Corporation's H-6, a derivative of the Soviet-era Tu-16 Badger, has been the centerpiece of China's bomber force since the 1970s.Read the original article.  \" \n",

      "https://news.yahoo.com/trump-rally-louisiana-governor-race-225109031.html\n",
      " \" WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump returned to the campaign trail Thursday to stump in Louisiana for the second time in as many weeks, using a raucous rally to mock two U.S. diplomats who raised questions about his dealings with Ukraine at the center of an impeachment inquiry.A day after a U.S. diplomat told lawmakers his staff overheard the president pressing for a Ukrainian investigation into his rivals – a bombshell revelation the president has denied – Trump was hoping to turn the tide in Louisiana's razor-thin race for governor. Trump has not scheduled any additional rallies through the remainder of the year.Speaking in Bossier City, Louisiana, at his first campaign rally since public hearings began Wednesday in the Democratic-led inquiry, Trump claimed that the impeachment hearings were helping his reelection effort. Trump's campaign said Thursday it had raised more than $3 million in the 24 hours after the hearing. \\\"The people of this country aren't buying it – you see it because we're going up and they're going down,\\\" Trump said. \\\"Let's keep it going for a while.\\\"Trump, who has repeatedly questioned the loyalty of Republican lawmakers in recent weeks, said the GOP is now sticking together, and \\\"it's a beautiful thing.\\\"Trump also mocked State Department official George Kent and Ambassador Bill Taylor, the first witnesses to testify in the public hearings, suggesting they didn't have an answer for why what they were describing is an impeachable offense. \\\"And they stood there and went like, 'what?'\\\"In fact, Kent and Taylor, who have served presidents of both parties, repeatedly said that they would not make a determination about whether Trump's actions were impeachable because that was a job for members of the House. Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, will testify Friday. Yovanovitch was recalled from Ukraine in May amid criticism in conservative media that she was an Obama holdover. Yovanovitch has, in fact, served presidents of both parties. Stung by Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin's loss last week to Democrat Andy Beshear, Trump is putting considerable emphasis on Louisiana. Republican businessman Eddie Rispone is challenging Democratic incumbent Gov. John Bel Edwards in a Nov. 16 runoff election.Trump touched on the Kentucky race briefly, pointing to other GOP wins in that state and in Mississippi. He told the crowd that Bevin, who conceded the race Thursday, would have performed worse without his involvement. \\\"You gotta give me a big win please,\\\" Trump told the crowd. \\\"Please.\\\" More: How to stay updated on USA TODAY's impeachment coverageTrump's Louisiana rally could be his last of 2019; his long-range schedule, including holidays at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, does not currently include additional political rallies, though he could always add them later. Trump did not mention Thursday’s deadly school shooting in California during his remarks, though he did tweet his condolences to the victims en route to the event.  Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, told lawmakers Wednesday was that one of his aides overheard a July 26 phone call between Trump and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, in which the president inquired about \\\"the investigations\\\" he had been pressing Zelensky to open. Trump had requested Zelensky investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company that had been under investigation, as well as alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 presidential election.The president told reporters Wednesday that he did not recall that conversation. \\\"First time I've heard it,\\\" Trump said. \\\"I don’t recall. Not at all. Not even a little bit.\\\"Contributing: Courtney SubramanianThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Trump holds rally in Louisiana for Rispone amid impeachment hearings \" \n",

      " \" By Mike StoneWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon found $81 million of military equipment at a U.S. Navy facility that had not been inventoried, a top Pentagon official said on Wednesday as he described the Department of Defense second straight failed audit.The Pentagon says that it has made progress toward fixing accounting discrepancies, but that it will take years to eventually pass a full audit, Deputy Secretary of Defense David Norquist told a U.S. Senate panel.One Navy base, the fleet logistics center in Jacksonville Florida, \\\"identified $81 million worth of active material not tracked in the inventory system.\\\" They also eliminated \\\"unneeded equipment\\\" freeing up 4.6 acres (1.9 hectares) of space he said.A 1990 federal law mandated that U.S. government agencies be audited.

      "https://news.yahoo.com/amazon-tried-remove-seattle-city-161131494.html\n",
      " \" Associated PressTo Amazon, $1.45 million isn't much money — a rounding error on the billions in revenue the retail giant brings in every year. Apply that $1.45 million to the Seattle City Council elections, however, and it's a far more significant sum.Of the seven Seattle city districts with races in 2019, most candidates received under $200,000 in donations. But in Seattle's third district, campaign contributions more than doubled that amount.That's because of Councilmember Kshama Sawant, a Seattle politician who's notoriously critical of Amazon's impact on Seattle.Amazon gave $1.45 million to a political action committee, the Civic Alliance for a Sound Economy, which lobbies on behalf of Seattle's business groups — the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce. And that PAC financially backed Sawant's opponent, Egan Orion, who received over $400,000 in campaign contributions.Despite the infusion of Amazon cash, Sawant won re-election to Seattle's City Council. She also raised over half a million dollars in campaign donations.AP Photo/Ted S. Warren\\\"This year's election — my second reelection — is historically significant because this time when we ran, we had very openly the entire business elite, the entire capitalist class in Seattle represented by multinational corporations, billionaires, millionaires, the uber-wealthy of this region, absolutely going to battle to try and defeat us,\\\" Sawant said in a phone interview with Business Insider last week.Sawant is neither a Democrat nor a Republican, but a self-described Socialist. She's a member of the activist organization Socialist Alternative. She's critical of both major political parties, and especially critical of the corporate behemoths that dominate the Seattle area.\\\"When you have a few corporations that are disproportionately more powerful in terms of their wealth and clout and political influence .... when you have that kind of deep chasm of political resources and wealth, that's when you see a city where — despite its historic level levels of wealth — you also see unprecedented levels of inequality,\\\" she said.To that end, Sawant's political platform has largely been in opposition to Amazon.In 2013, she helped pass legislation that increased Seattle's minimum wage to $15/hour — the first major city in the US to do as much. Though Amazon initially resisted, the company eventually gave in and instituted a company-wide $15/hour minimum rule.David Ryder/Getty ImagesIn 2018, she pushed for a new tax on corporations intended to address increasingly dire affordable-housing problems in Seattle.The head tax would've cost $275 per employee for companies with revenues exceeding $20 million annually — companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Boeing. And the revenues from that tax were intended to fund efforts to fix the affordable housing crisis.So the logic goes: As tech companies like Amazon attract higher-paid workers to cities like Seattle, those workers increase the cost of living. One of the costs of living that's most directly impacted is affordable housing, through simple supply-and-demand economics. As new workers move in, housing stock decreases while demand increases, resulting in higher prices for fewer places. The end result for Seattle has been a homelessness crisis.\\\"People are being priced out of very basic housing,\\\" Sharon Lee, executive director of Seattle's Low Income Housing Institute, told WUSA9 in February. \\\"We have so many people that have fallen into homelessness, or at the very edge of becoming homeless because of rent increases … they are literally being squeezed out of the home that they have lived in for 10-20 years.\\\"Though the new tax initially passed, Amazon pushed back and got it killed. How? By halting construction of a new tower in downtown Seattle and helping fund a campaign against the tax which ultimately convinced enough councilmembers to vote for a repeal.  Sawant was one of two City Councilmembers to vote against its repeal — \\\"a stark example of Amazon and billionaires and the Chamber of Commerce pushing for legislation their way,\\\" Sawant said.Associated PressIn 2019, Sawant has continued to advocate for policies that address the city's ongoing housing problem.A key slogan from her re-election campaign took aim directly at the city's most well-known company: \\\"TAX AMAZON! Affordable Housing for All!\\\" But Amazon isn't the only big corporation based in the Seattle metropolitan area. Microsoft and Boeing both have a major presence in the region, with the latter being the area's largest employer by far. To that end, Sawant explained, slogans like \\\"TAX AMAZON!\\\" only represent a symptom of a bigger problem.\\\"I don't think it's accurate to, just from a standpoint of scientific analysis, to just say that [Seattle's affordable housing crisis] is because of Amazon,\\\" Sawant said. \\\"Amazon is an example of what happens under Capitalism where the policy making of the city — when it's dominated by a political establishment that's tied to big business — what you see is primarily the city's policies being driven by the agenda of big business. And what does that mean? That means that Amazon has gotten — Jeff Bezos has gotten — to keep this city a corporate tax haven,\\\" she said.Amazon made headlines for paying $0 in federal taxes two years in a row, and reportedly paid about $250 million in state and local taxes in 2017.NYCEDCDuring its search for a second headquarters (\\\"HQ2\\\"), Amazon demanded massive tax breaks from city governments that wanted the retail giant to choose them. One such deal with New York City to put HQ2 in Queens ultimately fell apart amid complaints from local politicians that the multi-billion dollar company was getting $3 billion in tax breaks from the state.Without this kind of pushback from politicians representing concerned constituents, Sawant said, manifestations of inequality could get much worse.\\\"That is why it was so important for us to defeat Jeff Bezos in his attempt to take over City Hall this year,\\\" she said. \\\"Had we not, then the narrative would have been that big business can incompletely root out any progressive attempts towards, you know, towards making our cities affordable.\\\"Amazon representatives declined to comment for this story.NOW WATCH: Watch Elon Musk unveil his latest plan for conquering Mars \" \n",

      "https://news.yahoo.com/sheriff-school-based-deputy-had-221552214.html\n",
      " \" COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A former deputy working at a South Carolina high school had sex with a 17-year-old student in his patrol car while in uniform, Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott said Wednesday.Lott said 40-year-old Jamel Bradley is charged with third-degree criminal sexual conduct and the investigation into his conduct with other students at Spring Valley High School in Columbia continues.Bradley, a star basketball player at the University of South Carolina at the turn of the century, had been assigned to the school since 2009 but was removed in 2018 when he was sued in federal court over a relationship with a different student.The sex act with the 17-year-old that led to Bradley’s arrest Wednesday took place last year, Lott said. It did not happen at Spring Valley High School, where Bradley worked and the victim was a student, the sheriff said.“I’d like to kill you, but I can’t do that. I really would. It just disgusts me,” Lott said of his former deputy.Bradley has a bond hearing scheduled for Thursday. Court records indicate his lawyer in the civil suit no longer wants to represent him and there was no attorney listed for the criminal charge.Lott said investigators are looking at Bradley’s interactions with students and others going back to his hiring on the force in 2007. He was fired in October after lying and tampering with an internal investigation into his behavior, the sheriff said.“It’s still a very active investigation. But we felt like he needed to be arrested and he needed to be arrested today,” Lott said.The federal lawsuit against Bradley and the sheriff’s department includes other allegations of Bradley having had inappropriate contact with students. In one case, he was a girl’s friend on Facebook. In another case, a cheerleading coach from a different high school told officials that Bradley might be having inappropriate contact with a cheerleader.Bradley played basketball at South Carolina from 1998 to 2002. He was the team’s leading scorer as a junior and senior and still owns the Gamecocks record with 264 3-pointers.Bradley lost most of his hearing as a child, but the university arranged to get him hearing aids when he first arrived on campus and most of his hearing was restored.___Follow Jeffrey Collins on Twitter at https://twitter.com/JSCollinsAP \" \n",

    "text =  \" Police breached a Hong Kong university campus held by protesters early Monday after an all-night siege that included firing repeated barrages of tear gas and water cannons.Anti-government protesters have barricaded themselves inside Hong Kong Polytechnic University for days. Police surrounded the area Sunday night and began moving in after issuing an ultimatum for people to leave the area. The crowd wore raincoats and carried umbrellas to shield themselves.Riot officers broke in one entrance before dawn as fires raged inside and outside the school, but they didn’t appear to get very far. Fiery explosions could be seen as protesters responded with gasoline bombs. Police, who have warned that everyone in the area could be charged with rioting, reportedly made a handful of arrests.At daybreak, protesters remained in control of most of the campus. In one outdoor area, some demonstrators made gasoline bombs while others dozed while wearing gas masks. Two walked about with bows and quivers of arrows, while many stared at their smartphones.A lull settled on the area as the president of the university said in a video message that that police have agreed to suspend their use of force.Jin-Guang Teng said police would allow protesters to leave and he would accompany them to the police station to ensure their cases would be processed fairly.“I hope that you will accept the proposed temporary suspension of force and leave the campus in a peaceful manner,” he said.It seemed unlikely the protesters would accept the offer given that they would all likely be arrested.A few hundred streamed out of the campus about 8:15 a.m. in an apparent bid to escape, but they were driven back by police tear gas. Some wearing gas masks calmly picked up smoking tear gas canisters and dropped them into heavy-duty bags, but the protesters decided to retreat with a phalanx of officers lined up across the road in the distance.On Sunday, protesters used bows and arrows, and one arrow struck a media liaison officer in the calf. Photos on the department’s Facebook page show the arrow sticking out of the back of the officer’s leg through his pants.As riot police moved in from all sides, some protesters retreated inside the university. Others set fires on bridges leading to it.A huge blaze burned along much of a long footbridge that connects a train station to the campus over the approach to the Cross-Harbour Tunnel, a major road under Hong Kong’s harbor that has been blocked by protesters for days.The use of bows and arrows and gasoline bombs was a sharp escalation of violence by the protesters, who are trying to keep the pressure on Hong Kong leaders, who have rejected most of their demands.The protests started peacefully in early June, sparked by proposed legislation that would have criminal suspects to be extradited to the mainland. But by the time the bill was withdrawn, the protests had hardened and broadened into a resistance movement against the territory’s government and Beijing.Activists see the extradition bill as an example of Hong Kong’s eroding autonomy under Beijing rule since the 1997 handover from colonial power Britain.
