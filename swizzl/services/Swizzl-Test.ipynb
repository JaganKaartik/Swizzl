       " 'linktext': [' \" Jared Kushner has a new problem to solve. According to\\xa0the Washington Post, President Trump has recently tasked his son-in-law — whose to-do list already includes brokering peace in the Middle East, leading U.S. trade policy,\\xa0reorganizing the entire U.S. government\\xa0and reforming the criminal justice system — with overseeing the construction of his border wall ahead of the 2020 election.\\xa0The Post reports that Kushner’s latest assignment was borne out of Trump’s frustration over the lack of progress that has been made on his core campaign promise, as neither Mexico nor Congress have been willing to pay for the wall. Since Trump took office, just 83 miles of new barriers have been completed along the U.S.-Mexico border, almost all of which is what U.S. Customs and Border Protection calls “replacement wall,” meaning it was erected along sections of the border where older, smaller fencing structures already existed. According to the Washington Post, Trump wants Kushner to see to it that at least 400 new miles of wall are built by the time voters go to the polls next November.\\xa0The highly ambitious goal is just the latest in a\\xa0long and wide-ranging list of major projects\\xa0that Kushner has undertaken since he and his wife, Ivanka, followed Trump to the White House in 2017.\\xa0\\xa0One of Kushner’s first and most daunting assignments from Trump was to negotiate a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. Nearly three years later, the White House has\\xa0yet to unveil Kushner’s long-awaited Middle East peace plan, which experts already view as likely doomed when and if it is made public. A\\xa0partial outline of the plan, unveiled in June, called for a $50 billion commitment, largely paid by America’s European and Arab allies, to promote economic development in Palestinian territories as an incentive to acquiesce in Israel’s continued domination of the region.\\xa0Initially, Kushner’s lack of foreign policy experience was largely viewed as the biggest hurdle to his success in the Middle East. However, efforts to negotiate with Palestinian leaders have been undermined by\\xa0the Trump administration’s own policies, including the decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, cutting all U.S. aid to the West Bank and Gaza, and shutting down the Palestinian consulate in Washington. Amid political uncertainty in Israel, last week’s announcement by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that the U.S. no longer considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, seemed likely to\\xa0further reduce the prospects\\xa0of Kushner’s would-be plan.\\xa0The Middle East isn’t the only part of Kushner’s policy portfolio that has faced significant hurdles imposed by the president himself. Early in the administration, the soft-spoken Kushner emerged as\\xa0an approachable middleman\\xa0between his brash father-in-law and foreign officials. Kushner reportedly facilitated the first meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago, and\\xa0worked behind the scenes\\xa0to smooth relations with Mexican officials after Trump spent much of his time on the campaign trail attacking the country and its citizens. Much to the dismay of many in Mexico, President Enrique Peña Nieto\\xa0awarded Kushner\\xa0Mexico’s highest honor for foreigners for his role in helping to negotiate a new trade deal between the U.S., Mexico and Canada.But nearly a year after the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement (USCMA) was signed by the respective countries’ presidents, its ratification has been stalled in Congress. Meanwhile, Trump’s trade war with China\\xa0continues\\xa0despite\\xa0Kushner’s recent boast that the two countries have made a “fabulous deal” on trade.\\xa0Before taking on the border wall, Kushner had been working on a proposal to overhaul the complex immigration system, but his plan failed to win over Republican senators.\\xa0For someone whose work is often described as behind the scenes, it is perhaps fitting that Kushner’s biggest legislative accomplishment thus far — the passage of a major criminal justice reform bill — is one that Trump seems reluctant to talk about.\\xa0Trump does want to talk about how he’s following through on his promise to build a wall on the southern border. While it remains unclear how, exactly, Kushner intends to accomplish the daunting task of erecting more than 400 miles of wall by Election Day, he’s reportedly already overruling the objections of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and senior CBP officials and pushing forward with a plan to\\xa0live-stream the construction\\xa0project by webcam — proving that he really can get some things done.\\xa0_____Download the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.Read more from Yahoo News:Rebuilding Paradise: A year after the Camp Fire, one couple finds healing in starting overKey Democrat: House needs to \\'keep this simple\\' in crafting impeachment articlesAs Supreme Court weighs DACA, Trump pushes fiction about \\'hardened criminals\\'‘The 360’: What is ‘quid pro quo’ and does it matter?PHOTOS: Deadly earthquake rocks Albania \" ',\n",
       "  ' \" FURKA PASS, Switzerland — On the hairpin bend of a Swiss mountain pass, a Victorian-era hotel built for tourists to admire the Rhone Glacier has been abandoned now that the ice has retreated nearly 1.2 miles uphill.Where mighty glaciers once spilled into Swiss valleys like frozen rivers of ice, a residue of gray scree and boulders remains, spliced through with raging streams.A collection of images — showing photos of modern-day mountain landscapes next to archive shots of the same scenes decades earlier — reveals the dramatic change.More than 500 Swiss glaciers have already vanished, and the government says 90 percent of the remaining 1,500 will go by the end of the century if nothing is done to cut emissions.Their retreat is expected to have a major impact on water levels — possibly raising them initially as the ice melts but depleting them long term. Officials fear the changes could trigger rockfalls and other hazards and affect the economy.The Belvedere Hotel, built in the 1880s during a surge in Alpine tourists, was an early victim of the decline. Once the scene of wild parties, it features in a James Bond car chase in “Goldfinger.”Visitors can still walk into a cave carved into the glacier. But the ice above is now draped with huge white sheets to reflect the sun’s heat. Despite such efforts, meltwater has formed a green lake.Down the valley, a mid-19th-century photograph shows the glacier’s bulging snout more than 100 meters thick. Now animals graze and a river meanders on the same spot.In another archive photograph taken in the late 19th century in front of the Aletsch Glacier — the largest in the Alps — a man sits on a boulder in front of a huge ice channel that merges with the main ice stream below. Today they no longer join.Landlocked Switzerland is warming at twice the global rate, and over the last year its glaciers have lost 2 percent of volume, said Mathias Huss, who heads Switzerland\\'s glacier monitoring institute, GLAMOS, which has data stretching back 150 years.“We have never seen such a fast rate of glacial decline since the measurements have started,” he said.Some hope that politics can make a difference, especially after the Green party surged in an October election.The Glacier Initiative, calling for more climate measures, collected more than the 100,000 signatures required to trigger a referendum and will be sent to Bern this week.But the glaciers will keep shrinking, scientists say. “The Alps will still be beautiful in my opinion, but they will be different,” Huss said.

       "  ' \" Berlin (AFP) - A 49-carat diamond which analysts estimate to be worth up to $12 million was among over a dozen jewel-encrusted items snatched from a German state museum in a spectacular heist, the museum confirmed Wednesday.Publishing a list of the pieces taken in Monday\\'s brazen raid, the Green Vault museum at Dresden\\'s royal palace said the items stolen included a sword whose hilt is encrusted with nine large and 770 smaller diamonds, and a shoulderpiece which contains the famous 49-carat Dresden white diamond.Eleven pieces were removed completely, while individual parts of a further three items were also missing.The Dresden white is one of the most precious jewels in the collection of former Saxon ruler August the Strong.Tobias Kormind, managing director of the diamond retailer 77Diamonds, told AFP that it could be worth up to $10 or $12 million, adding that thieves would have \\\\\"hit the jackpot\\\\\" if they did take it.\\\\\"None of the diamonds would have been in themselves extra special except for the one large Dresden White,\\\\\" he said.The 49-carat diamond was cut in the early 18th century and bought at great expense by August the Strong, then Elector of Saxony, in 1728.- \\'Criminal gang\\' -In dramatic CCTV footage released by police on Monday, one of the suspects can be seen using an axe to break into the display case containing three diamond jewellery collections.The thieves launched their audacious raid in the early hours of Monday morning, instigating a partial powercut before breaking through a window protected by iron bars.They then headed straight for the display cabinet in what police said was a \\\\\"targeted and premeditated crime\\\\\".Police said Wednesday that after studying the video material, they now believed that there were four perpetrators in total.Having called for witnesses to come forward earlier in the week, the investigative commission said they had received 205 tip-offs from the public by Wednesday afternoon.Dresden police chief Joerg Kubiessa told broadcaster ZDF that a \\\\\"criminal gang\\\\\" may be behind the robbery.Dresden police said they were also in contact with colleagues in Berlin to explore possible connections to a similar heist in the capital two years ago.In 2017, a 100-kilogramme (220-pound), 24-karat giant gold coin was stolen from Berlin\\'s Bode Museum.Four men with links to a notorious Berlin gang were later arrested and put on trial.The coin has never been recovered, and fears are growing that the Dresden treasures will also remain lost forever.- Security conference -With Germany reeling from what Bild and Handelsblatt newspapers called \\\\\"the biggest art heist in modern history\\\\\", questions were raised about how the thieves were able to break in so easily.\\\\\"How safe are Germany\\'s museums really?\\\\\" asked regional broadcaster MDR.On Tuesday evening, the director of Dresden\\'s state art collections Marion Ackermann defended the security measures at the Green Vault, saying that around \\\\\"eight million euros\\\\\" were spent on security ever year.In a statement on Germany\\'s culture minister Monika Gruetters called for a national conference on museum security.\\\\\"We need to look at how museums can protect their objects from such brutal activities while still being accessible to the public in the normal way,\\\\\" she said. \" ',\n",
       "  ' \" A new wildfire has been blazing near Santa Barbara ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.The Cave Fire quickly burned through 4,367 acres since it started Monday afternoon—and it remains 20% contained as of Wednesday morning, according to Cal Fire, one of the lead agencies overseeing the fire. Approximately 600 firefighters have been assigned and evacuation orders were issued for more than 2,280 residents, while still other areas are under evacuation warning. All evacuation orders were officially lifted Wednesday morning, Santa Barbara County announced. “With good progress on the fire fight, repopulation plans are being evaluated and all should be in their homes later today and in time for Thanksgiving,” the county said in a Tweet.#CaveFire- UPDATE- IC reporting that with good progress on the fire fight, repopulation plans are being evaluated and all should be in their homes later today and in time for Thanksgiving. We thank you for helping the community as a whole work together to keep everyone safe.But on Tuesday evening, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office had issued an additional evacuation warning in some locations due to the potential for debris flow as the result of a storm that struck Tuesday night and is expected to carry on into Wednesday.It comes less than a month after the Kinkade Fire burned more than 77,758 acres in Sonoma County, Calif. and the Maria Fire burned through nearly 2,000 acres of Southern California.Los Padres National Forest fire chief Jimmy Harris told reporters Tuesday afternoon that firefighters are working in some of the toughest conditions in the world. “It’s just a hard, difficult piece of country to fight fire in,” he said.The #Cavefire started at approximately 4:15pm yesterday, Nov. 25 off of Highway 154 and Painted Cave Rd. on the Santa Barbara Ranger District. The Fire is currently estimated at 4,100 acres and 0% contained. For the latest evacuation information, view https://t.co/3tKI3Etlw2. pic.twitter.com/dyTny9ci0rSanta Barbara officials declared a local emergency on Monday evening. “The Cave Fire is causing conditions of extreme peril to the safety of persons and property within Santa Barbara County,” wrote the officials in a public statement released early Tuesday morning. “These conditions are beyond the control of the services, personnel, equipment and facilities of the combined forces of the county’s Operational Area to combat. Additional resources have been ordered from out of the area, which have been arriving all evening.”Meanwhile, an additional fire in Northern California’s Yolo County is mostly contained as of Tuesday afternoon. Here’s what to know about the wildfires still raging in California.The Cave wildfire began around 4 p.m. Monday off Highway 154 in the Santa Ynez Mountains several miles north of Santa Barbara, and officials warned early Tuesday that the fire was advancing toward heavily populated areas including Santa Barbara and Goleta.Santa Barbara Sheriff Bill Brown told reporters on Tuesday that as of that afternoon, 2,284 residents had been contacted by the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Department and told to evacuate. Brown added that more than 1,300 had already evacuated on their own, but about 300 indicated they would not be evacuating. In total, the department estimates more than 5,400 people had abandoned the area.County officials said no residential homes have been damaged so far, but one outpost building has been destroyed. No injuries have been reported.The fire threatened power lines, and power outages have been reported that are not related to precautionary power shut offs by Southern California Edison, the region’s power supplier, according to the county.On Tuesday, Santa Barbara Air Pollution and Control issued an air quality warning for the county, urging people to stay indoors and close their doors and windows.We are issuing an Air Quality Warning in partnership with @SBCPublicHealth due to elevated levels of smoke from the #CaveFire off HWY 154. See below for details: pic.twitter.com/nQ9mICMO0wCal Fire San Luis Obispo Unit Chief Scotty Jalpert said that just a few years ago wildfire season typically ended around Nov. 1, but in recent years that season has expanded, forcing agencies across the state to extend their efforts. “Unfortunately, we’ve gotten really good at this, working together,” Jalpert told reporters Tuesday afternoon.The Cashe wildfire in northern California near Woodland, northwest of Sacramento, was nearly 100% contained as of Tuesday afternoon, a spokesperson for Yolo County tells TIME in a statement. The spokesperson did not immediately provide the official acreage burned during the fire.The Woodland Fire Department shared on Facebook that local agencies are currently fighting an additional fire that has burned 60 acres, but added “currently there are no threats to structures, although drivers on I-5 may experience smoky conditions.” \" ',\n",
       "  ' \" Wikimedia/DuffmanImmigration and Customs Enforcement has arrested 90 more students who enrolled in a fake university set up by federal authorities as part of an immigration bust, the Detroit Free Press reported on Wednesday.As The Detroit News first reported in January, hundreds of foreign students were arrested after enrolling in the University of Farmington, a fake college the Department of Homeland Security established as part of a sting operation to apprehend and prosecute people committing visa and immigration fraud.The Free Press reported that since then, an estimated 250 students, many of whom came from India, had lost their visas and been arrested on charges of immigration and visa fraud.ICE officials told the outlet that out of the 250 students, \\\\\"nearly 80% were granted voluntary departure and departed the United States,\\\\\" while the other 20% had received official deportation orders or were fighting in court to stay in the United States.Furthermore, the Free Press reported that seven of eight people identified by prosecutors as recruiters for the fake university had pleaded guilty to charges that they facilitated a conspiracy to commit visa fraud by helping nearly 600 students obtain falsified transcripts and records from the university to secure student visas.The grand-jury indictment filed against six of the people alleged that \\\\\"the University was being used by foreign citizens as a \\'pay to stay\\' scheme which allowed these individuals to stay in the United States as a result of foreign citizens falsely asserting that they were enrolled as full-time students in an approved educational program and that they were making normal progress toward completion of the course of study.\\\\\"Federal authorities created the university as a component of \\\\\"Operation Paper Chase\\\\\" in 2015, part of a wider crackdown on illegal immigration and visa fraud.Authorities created a website with a .edu address and social-media pages advertising the university as an accredited institution charging $8,500 per year in tuition, but it had no physical classrooms or campus and was not accredited.The Free Press said it obtained emails showing that students paid an average of about $12,000 in tuition and other fees to the fake university, meaning the government likely made millions of dollars in the operation.Some critics and immigration advocates have charged that the government\\'s scheme unfairly entrapped and set up foreign students simply seeking to work legally in the United States, but authorities maintain that nearly all the students arrested in the sting knew the university was fake.The students\\' \\\\\"true intent could not be clearer,\\\\\" a federal prosecutor wrote in a sentencing memo for one of the recruiters, the Free Press reported.\\\\\"While \\'enrolled\\' at the University, one hundred percent of the foreign citizen students never spent a single second in a classroom.

       "  ' \" SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Utah is on its way to becoming the 19th state to ban the discredited practice of conversion therapy in January after state officials formed a proposal that has the support of the influential Church of a Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.Republican Gov. Gary Herbert announced Tuesday night that church leaders back a regulatory rule his office helped craft after legislative efforts for a ban on the therapy failed earlier this year.The faith known widely as the Mormon church opposed a previous version of the rule because it wanted assurances that church leaders and members who are therapists would be allowed to provide spiritual counseling for parishioners or families — which were included in the latest conversion therapy ban plan.The faith opposes gay marriage and teaches that intimidate same-sex relationships are a sin. The religion has stuck to that belief while urging members to be kind and compassionate to LGBTQ people.Conversion therapy is a practice used to try to change peoples’ sexual orientation or gender identity.The rule would ban Utah therapists from subjecting LGBTQ minors to the practice that the American Psychological Association has said is not based in science and is harmful to mental health. The Utah rule proposal is set to go to a 30-day public comment period beginning Dec. 15 and take effect as soon as Jan. 22, Herbert said.The success in getting the church’s crucial support for the regulatory rule generated praise from LGBTQ advocates and conversion therapy survivors who had expressed frustration with the yearslong battle in Utah to ban conversion therapy. The rule uses language from a state legislative proposal that failed this year despite church leaders saying they would not oppose it.“It means youth will be getting adequate services that will help them rather than harm them,” said Nathan Dalley, 20, who had conversion therapy when he was 16. “This is a change that’s been needed for so long. It’s too late, but I’m happy it is here.”Dalley grew up as a member of the Latter-day Saint faith and said he was told during his therapy to snap a rubber band on his wrist every time he felt attracted to men. His therapist also scrutinized his posture, his walk, his gestures and interests. Dalley said the experience deepened his feelings of depression and culminated in a suicide attempt several months after the therapy.Church government affairs director Marty Stephens reiterated in the governor’s news release that the faith denounces conversion therapy and wants a ban. He said in an interview with The Associated Press last month that the faith doesn\\'t ascribe to \\\\\"pray the gay away\\\\\" thinking but that prayer and religious teachings can be helpful to people trying to navigate life\\'s challenges.The religion holds tremendous influence in Utah, where the majority of state lawmakers and nearly two-thirds of the state’s 3.1 million residents are members of the faith. Herbert is a member and so are all six members of the state’s congressional delegation, including U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney.The church had said in an Oct. 15 letter to state regulators that it would support a \\\\\"carefully tailored\\\\\" rule to ban \\\\\"abusive\\\\\" practices like conversion therapy but contended an earlier regulatory proposal banning the practice defined sexual orientation and efforts to change sexual orientation so broadly that it \\\\\"would imperil legitimate and helpful therapies to the detriment of minor clients.\\\\\"For example, the church had claimed the bill would have prohibited therapists from discussing strategies for avoiding same-sex intimacy when young people seek help to adhere to the faith\\'s teachings.The revised rule stipulates that the ban doesn’t apply to clergy members or religious counselors acting in a religious capacity, or to a parents or grandparents who happen to be a mental health therapist if they are talking to children or grandchildren.Justin Utley, 42, who attempted suicide more than a decade ago after going through conversion therapy, said he’s concerned about the exceptions granted to the church even but said the new rule is a positive step.“Progress is progress in this state. You kind of have to make some compromises,” Utley said. “My concern, though, is clergy who are licensed professionals having this ability to justify conversion therapy by claiming that they’ve turned off the switch and now are acting as a clergy member instead of a licensed professional. That’s a very dangerous precedent.”During a public hearing about the rule in September, Utley and other supporters of a conversion therapy ban said enduring the therapy led to shame, depression and suicide attempts.Opponents argued that the rule would prevent parents from getting help for children with \\\\\"unwanted\\\\\" gay feelings or even from talking about sexuality with their kids.Herbert said “the stories of youth who have endured these so-called therapies are heart rending.”He added: “I’m grateful that we have found a way forward that will ban conversion therapy forever in our state.” \" ',\n",

       "  ' \" At a rally in Sunrise, Fla., on Tuesday night, President Trump declared a victory in the imaginary “war on Christmas” while warning of a new one: the war on Thanksgiving.“Some people want to change the name ‘Thanksgiving,’”\\xa0Trump told his supporters. “They don’t want to use the term ‘Thanksgiving.’ And that was true also with Christmas. But now everybody is using ‘Christmas’ again. Remember I said that?”Trump has often boasted about his leadership in saving Christmas from people who wish their acquaintances “happy holidays.” He did so at an interfaith dinner —\\xa0in May.“But now we’re going to have to do a little work on Thanksgiving,” the president continued. “People have different ideas why it shouldn’t be called Thanksgiving, but everybody in this room I know loves the name ‘Thanksgiving,’ and we’re not changing it.”Like the so-called war on Christmas, the rhetorical assault on Thanksgiving is a notion that largely originated with Fox News.Earlier this month, HuffPost\\xa0published an article, “The Environmental Impact Of Your Thanksgiving Dinner,” that offered suggestions for meatless alternatives to the traditional turkey-centric meal. The author, Alexandra Emanuelli, also suggested buying locally sourced ingredients and gathering in a location that requires less travel in order to minimize the impact on the environment.She did not suggest changing the name of the holiday.For Fox News hosts, the article was the perfect stuffing, spoon-fed to viewers of “Fox & Friends,” “The Five” and “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” among other shows on the president’s favorite cable network.And\\xa0from Fox News to Trump’s mouth.“Liberals are coming for your Thanksgiving turkey!” declared Greg Gutfeld, co-host of “The Five,” on Nov. 6, a day after the article was published.The show included a giant graphic emblazoned with “War on Thanksgiving” as a backdrop.On “Fox & Friends” the next day, co-host Ainsley Earhardt falsely claimed the HuffPost piece was “telling America cancel Thanksgiving because of the carbon footprint, telling you not to travel to see family, don’t eat meat, eat veggies.”“Don’t tell us what we can and cannot eat,” said “Fox & Friends” guest Lynette Hardaway, aka Diamond of the Fox Nation duo Diamond and Silk. “If you have a problem with climate change, stop driving cars, ride on your horse to work. You do everything you can to fix the climate, but don’t infringe upon my right to have Thanksgiving with my family.”Tucker Carlson also falsely claimed that the article was “demanding that you cancel Thanksgiving dinner.”Other conservative news outlets pounced too.“Your Thanksgiving, they’d like to remind you, is slowly destroying the climate and killing the earth,”\\xa0Emily Zanotti wrote in the Daily Wire on Nov. 6. “Your turkey is choking off the planet and probably leaving your children to die vying for the last can of tuna in an arid, apocalyptic landscape. Your mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce is causing your next mass extinction.”On Wednesday morning,\\xa0a “Fox & Friends” segment\\xa0recapped the president’s remarks at the rally suggesting there was a so-called war on Thanksgiving. Co-host Brian Kilmeade was skeptical.“I don’t think there’s a huge push to change the name of Thanksgiving, is there?” Kilmeade asked.Co-host Steve Doocy replied: “Well, you know, uh, I think it was in 2015 there was a rumor that Barack Obama wanted to change the name.”But as Doocy pointed out, that rumor was\\xa0debunked._____Download the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.Read more from Yahoo News:Trump claims he\\'d \\'love\\' for top aides to testify, but won\\'t allow itTrump says Kellyanne \\'must have done some bad things\\' to George ConwayTrump in \\'Fox & Friends\\' rant says he still is looking for nonexistent DNC serverHow Elise Stefanik became one of the president\\'s most ferocious supportersTrump supporters say God chose him to be president \" ',\n",

       "  ' \" Dien Chau (Vietnam) (AFP) - The first remains of the 39 people found dead in a truck in Britain last month arrived in Vietnam Wednesday where they were met by huge crowds of sobbing relatives who have been waiting weeks for their return.Sixteen bodies were flown from London to Hanoi, where they were quickly shuttled in ambulances to their hometowns in central Vietnam.Hundreds of people filled the compound of a church in rural Dien Chau district in central Nghe An province to greet two returned bodies, many carrying white flowers to offer the families of the dead.The cousin of 33-year-old victim Nguyen Van Hung waited hours in the crowd near the town church.\\\\\"He was a nice man. No one expected him to return home like this,\\\\\" said the cousin, refusing to be named, as relatives wept nearby.Hung was among 31 men and eight women found dead in a refrigerated truck in an industrial park in Essex, east of London, on October 23.Victims\\' relatives have taken out hefty loans from the government to cover the cost of repatriation: $1,800 to bring back ashes, or $2,900 for the cost of a coffin carrying the body.Authorities in Vietnam encouraged relatives to opt for ashes \\\\\"to ensure speed, low cost and sanitation safety\\\\\", but many paid more for the bodies so they could carry out traditional burials.Cremation is rare in the Vietnam countryside, where many of the victims were from.Some funerals were due to start Wednesday and burials could take place later this week.- \\'We are very sad\\' -The rest of the remains are expected to arrive in Vietnam this weekend, though officials have not announced the schedule.All 16 victims whose bodies came back on Wednesday hailed from three provinces -- Nghe An, Ha Tinh and Quang Binh.It was a painful homecoming for families who have been suspended in grief for weeks anticipating their relatives\\' return.\\\\\"We have been waiting for this moment for a very long time. We will organise the funeral as soon as he\\'s returned,\\\\\" said Vo Van Binh, whose son Vo Van Linh was among the victims.\\\\\"We are very sad but happy as finally my son is back,\\\\\" he told AFP from central Ha Tinh province, where the family had gathered awaiting the arrival of Linh\\'s body.The tragedy exposed the dangers of illegal journeys from Vietnam to the United Kingdom, a top destination for migrants from Vietnam.Most of the victims hailed from just a handful of central Vietnamese provinces, which are among the poorest in the country and where well-entrenched networks of brokers help to facilitate the risky trips abroad.Ten of the dead were teenagers, including two 15-year-old boys.Britain\\'s ambassador to Vietnam Gareth Ward sent his condolences to families on Wednesday in a video message, saying it was a \\\\\"very difficult time\\\\\".He promised families the UK and Vietnam would cooperate to \\\\\"prevent human trafficking and protect vulnerable people here\\\\\".Several families told AFP they went deep into debt after borrowing money to pay for their children\\'s journeys overseas, and would now struggle to repay the cost of repatriation as well.Their children were promised well-paid jobs, possibly in nail bars or cannabis farms where many Vietnamese migrants end up.Several of the 39 people who died last month paid thousands of dollars to brokers who promised the truck -- billed as the \\\\\"VIP route\\\\\" -- was the safer option, their families told AFP.On Monday, the Northern Irish driver of the truck, 25-year-old Maurice Robinson, pleaded guilty to conspiring to assist illegal immigration.He also admitted acquiring cash that came from criminal conduct. He did not enter pleas to 41 other charges levelled against him.Several other people have been arrested in the UK over the incident, while Vietnam has held at least 10 people, though none has been formally charged. \" ',\n",

       "  ' \" The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) last week released a landmark report analyzing the capabilities of Iran’s military. In light of Iran’s September attacks on the Abqaiq and Khurais oil facilities in eastern Saudi Arabia, the report’s emphasis on Tehran’s expanding cruise missile capabilities has already proven to be prescient.The DIA’s new report, titled Iran Military Power: Ensuring Regime Survival and Securing Regional Dominance, highlights Tehran’s development of land-attack cruise missiles (LACMs). The report notes that Tehran “has invested heavily in its domestic infrastructure, equipment, and expertise” to develop increasingly capable cruise missiles.Tehran’s investment of its limited resources in LACMs is not surprising, given the challenges LACMs create for opposing air defense forces. The DIA notes that LACMs “present a unique threat profile from ballistic missiles because they can fly at low altitude and attack a target from multiple directions.”This low and unpredictable flight path utilizes ground features for concealment and makes it more difficult to detect and track the cruise missile – essential precursors to intercepting it. The September attacks on Abqaiq and Khurais demonstrated the value of such concealment; Iran reportedly used seven cruise missiles (along with 18 drones) to target the Saudi installations from an unexpected direction.Read the original article.  \" ',\n",

The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the 12-hour hostage crisis.Security forces shot dead five attackers and also, reports say mistakenly, a pizza chef during the rescue operation codenamed “Thunderbolt.”The convicts yelled “Allahu Akbar,” or “Allah is the greatest,” in the courtroom, according to prosecutor Abu.At least two suspected militants tied to the attack are at large, according to Monirul Islam, chief of the police’s counterterrorism unit.To contact the reporter on this story: Arun Devnath in Dhaka at adevnath@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Arijit Ghosh at aghosh@bloomberg.net, Jeanette Rodrigues, Abhay SinghFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P. \" ',\n",
       "  ' \" WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern apologized on Thursday for the then-government\\'s handling of a plane crash in Antarctica 40 years ago that took the lives of 257 people in the country\\'s worst peacetime disaster.On 28 November 1979, Air New Zealand flight 901 was on a sightseeing tour from Auckland when it crashed into the side of Mount Erebus, a 3,794 meter (12,448 ft) volcano near the U.S. Antarctic research base of McMurdo Station.Most of the 237 passengers and 20 crew killed were New Zealanders but other nationalities included Americans, Canadians, Japanese and Australians.Originally the crash was blamed on the pilots, but following a public outcry, a Royal Commission of Inquiry was set up to investigate the disaster. It concluded the main cause of the accident was the state-owned airline’s actions in reprogramming the aircraft’s navigation system without advising the aircrew.The Commission head, former justice Peter Mahon, controversially also said witnesses from Air New Zealand had conspired to give false evidence, famously describing the airline\\'s defense as \\\\\"an orchestrated litany of lies\\\\\". \\xa0This led to his report being criticized by both Air New Zealand and the government.\\xa0The actions of the then government and the airline caused more pain and grief to the victims\\' families, Prime Minister Ardern said at a memorial service at the Government House in Auckland on Thursday.\\\\\"After forty years, on behalf of today’s government, the time has come to apologize for the actions of an airline then in full state ownership; which ultimately caused the loss of the aircraft and the loss of those you loved,\\\\\" Ardern said in her speech.\\\\\"The pilots were not responsible for this tragedy, and I stand here today to state that again,\\\\\" she added.Ardern acknowledged the findings of the Royal Commission were not accepted by the government of the day, and it was only nearly 20 years later the report was even presented in parliament.In 2009, Air New Zealand apologized to the families of the victims for mistakes made by the airline in the aftermath of the crash, and on Thursday Air New Zealand Chairman Therese Walsh also expressed regret.\\\\\"I apologize on behalf of an airline which 40 years ago failed in its duty of care to its passengers and staff,\\\\\" said Walsh.(Reporting by Praveen Menon.

       "  ' \" SHANGHAI — The teenage girl, pink eyelash curler in hand, begins her video innocently: “Hi, guys. I’m going to teach you guys how to get long lashes.”After a few seconds, she asks viewers to put down their curlers. “Use your phone that you’re using right now to search up what’s happening in China, how they’re getting concentration camps, throwing innocent Muslims in there,” she says.The sly bait-and-switch puts a serious topic — the mass detentions of minority Muslims in northwest China — in front of an audience that might not have known about it before. The 40-second clip has amassed more than 498,000 likes on TikTok, a social platform where the users skew young and the videos skew silly.But the video’s creator, Feroza Aziz, said this week that TikTok had suspended her account after she posted the clip. That added to a widespread fear about the platform: that its owner, Chinese social media giant ByteDance, censors or punishes videos that China’s government might not like.A ByteDance spokesman, Josh Gartner, said Aziz had been blocked from her TikTok account because she used a previous account to post a video that contained an image of Osama bin Laden. This violated TikTok’s policies against terrorist content, Gartner said, which is why the platform banned both her account and the devices from which she was posting.“If she tries to use the device that she used last time, she will probably have a problem,” Gartner said.Aziz, a 17-year-old Muslim high school student in New Jersey, said in an email on Tuesday that her TikTok videos tried to make light of the racism and discrimination she experienced growing up in the United States. In one video, she addressed a slur that she said she and other Muslims heard regularly: that they would marry bin Laden.“I think that TikTok should not ban content that doesn’t harm anyone or shows anyone being harmed,” Aziz said.In recent months, U.S. lawmakers have expressed concerns that TikTok censors video content at Beijing’s behest and shares user data with Chinese authorities.The head of TikTok, Alex Zhu, denied those accusations in an interview with The Times this month. Zhu said that Chinese regulators did not influence TikTok in any way and that even ByteDance could not control TikTok’s policies for managing video content in the United States.But episodes such as Aziz’s show how difficult it might be for TikTok to escape the fog of suspicion that surrounds it and other Chinese tech companies.China’s government rigidly controls the internet within the nation’s borders. It exerts influence, sometimes subtly, over the activities of private businesses. The concern is that, when companies like ByteDance and telecom equipment maker Huawei expand overseas, Beijing’s long arm follows them.China would certainly prefer that the world did not talk about its clampdown on Muslims. Over the past few years, the government has corralled as many as 1 million ethnic Uighurs, Kazakhs and others into internment camps and prisons.Chinese leaders have presented their efforts as a mild and benevolent campaign to fight Islamic extremism. But internal Communist Party documents reported by The Times this month provided an inside glimpse at the crackdown and confirmed its coercive nature.On Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at a news conference in Washington that the documents showed “brutal detention and systematic repression” of Uighurs and called on China to immediately release those who were detained. President Donald Trump, however, has refused to impose sanctions on Chinese officials deemed responsible, despite recommendations from some U.S. officials to do so.This article originally appeared in\\xa0The New York Times.© 2019 The New York Times Company \" ',\n",

       "  ' \" While I have been researching and writing a Wampanoag-centered history of Plymouth Colony and the Thanksgiving holiday, my conversations with Native people have opened my eyes to some profound lessons about their past and present. These teachings have particular resonance this Thanksgiving season as the United States continues to struggle with white nationalism, the importance of distinguishing between truth and lies in democratic debate, and the place of indigenous people in a pluralistic country with a colonial foundation.Native people widely agree that the U.S. has yet to reckon with its history of white violence against their people. Instead, the country uses the myth of the First Thanksgiving to make it appear that Indians consented bloodlessly to colonialism.That myth, reinforced over and over again through grade school Thanksgiving pageants, holiday decorations, and television specials, is the only cameo Indians make in the colonial history curriculum in many American schools. Unfortunately, it is terrible history and even worse civics.The myth tells that supposedly friendly Indians (rarely identified by tribe) voluntarily gifted their country to the Pilgrims in order to lay the foundations for a white, Christian, democratic United States. As for why these Indians were so welcoming in the first place, this myth has nothing to say. It does not address the fact that the Wampanoags had already experienced years of slave raiding by European sailors before the appearance of the Mayflower, and that those contacts had introduced them to a devastating plague that more than halved their population and left them vulnerable to their inter-tribal enemies. Thus, when the Pilgrims arrived, the Wampanoags looked to them for a military alliance despite their wariness of English treachery.Why Thanksgiving Is Better Than ChristmasThe Thanksgiving Myth also evades the fact that the celebrated peace between the Wampanoags and Plymouth was rife with tensions from the start and ultimately degenerated into a bloody war. During the celebrated 50 years of peace following the First Thanksgiving, the Wampanoags complained endlessly about the English encroaching on their land, undermining their political systems, and asserting their jurisdiction over purely Indian affairs.Not coincidentally, there were recurrent war scares during these years as Native leaders reached across tribal lines to make common cause against their common colonial threat. The tension finally broke in King Philip’s War of 1675-76, which led to the deaths of thousands of Wampanoag, Narragansett, Nipmuc, and other indigenous people, and the enslavement of thousands more. The Thanksgiving Myth ignores this consequence of the Pilgrim-Wampanoag alliance, though clashes of this sort were a basic feature of American colonial history.Some American history courses might teach about King Philip’s War, but few have anything to say about how many Wampanoags and other Native New Englanders survived after their military subjugation. Over the following centuries, they endured white society’s reduction of them and their children to indentured servitude and the ongoing occupation of their lands. They also suffered white people denying they were Indians at all based on the intermarriages and cultural adjustments they had made to survive under white domination. In other words, Americans are rarely taught the incredible achievement that American Indians are still here, every bit as much a part of the modern world as everyone else.Indigenous people also widely bemoan that Americans’ lack of historical understanding about the Native American contributes to a marked lack of recognition of their place in the country, a general lack of compassion for their historic struggles, and widespread unawareness about their ongoing fights for sovereignty and cultural self-determination. Indeed, many of them feel invisible to the general public.Worse still, every Thanksgiving season the country reduces historic Indians and their traumas to caricature, as if to say that Native Americans’ only role in the national culture is to concede to colonialism and then go away.Lest we diminish the impact of these messages, consider the experience of a young Wampanoag woman who told me that when she was in kindergarten, the lone Indian in her class, her teacher cast her as Chief Massasoit in a Thanksgiving pageant and had her sing with her classmates “This Land is Your Land, This Land is My Land.” Reflecting on the moment as an adult, the cruel irony was not lost on her. As a child, she only knew enough to be embarrassed about it.The Trump era has cast into relief some of the dark consequences of this amnesia and ignorance. It includes the government’s environmental racism and disregard of Native sovereignty evident in the battle over the Keystone Pipeline. It includes the ongoing use of racist stereotypes of indigenous people in sports mascots. It includes President Donald Trump’s derision of Sen. Elizabeth Warren as Pocahontas, which feeds on the widespread assumption that it is ludicrous for someone with a light (or dark) complexion leading a modern life to have Native heritage and want to claim it.Trump’s juvenile trolling of Warren also plays on the widespread ignorance of the American public about the difference between being an enrolled member of an Indian tribe (which Warren is not) and being a descendant of Native people (which Warren is). Such thinking is part of a long American tradition of white people insisting that Indians should disappear, the better to reduce the numbers of them laying claim to the land.The belief that Indians do not matter also contributed to Trump posing a delegation of Navajo leaders visiting the White House in front of a portrait of Andrew Jackson, the proponent of Indian Removal, and then making light on Twitter about the historic massacre of Wounded Knee.Not least of all, the widespread belief that modern Indians cannot be authentic and have no legitimate historic rights has contributed to a recent decision by Trump’s Department of the Interior to revoke a 2007 federal ruling that restored reservation lands to the Mashpee Wampanoags of Cape Cod, descendants of the very people who welcomed the Pilgrims.No wonder, then, that many Native people, including the Wampanoags, charge that their fellow Americans lack sufficient gratitude for what they’ve sacrificed for the country. This feeling of victimhood is especially poignant given that many Native communities still suffer extraordinarily high levels of poverty, with all of its associated ills, while living in the shadow of sometimes garish wealth. Wampanoag people in southeastern New England, for instance, are confronted daily with the sight of outsiders’ extravagant coastal estates, occupied for only six or eight weeks in summer, built atop places where the ancestors are buried and where some of them fished, hunted, and gathered within memory. The image sickens and depresses. And yet there is no escaping it or the sense that other Americans revel in it.In Thanksgiving season, one cannot drive past neighbors’ lawns or go to the store without confronting happy Pilgrim and Indian decorations, or turn on the television, radio, or computer without being bombarded with Pilgrim and Indian themes. Some schools continue to have children, including Native children, perform Thanksgiving pageants. For these reasons and more, the United New England Indians have held a National Day of Mourning in Plymouth every Thanksgiving Day since 1970, which is attended by indigenous people from throughout the hemisphere. They do not see American colonialism as something to celebrate.Part of what I’ve learned through my conversations with Wampanoag people is that achieving some measure of repair and signaling that Americans value their Native countrymen and women requires compassion, gratitude, and a willingness to confront uncomfortable history. Taking these steps might also help us, collectively, to restore basic dignity, intelligence, and humanity to our civic culture.\\xa0Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

       "  ' \" DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A British newspaper editor convicted of killing his wife with a hammer had his sentence reduced by Dubai’s Court of Appeal on Wednesday.The court ordered that former Gulf News editor Francis Matthew must serve a seven-year sentence for manslaughter in the 2017 killing of his wife, Jane.Matthew had received as much as a 15-year sentence for the killing. A series of appeals has seen his sentence change and his case go before Dubai’s Court of Appeal.Matthew’s lawyer Ali al-Shamsi had previously asked the court to reduce his client’s sentence to two years in prison, saying evidence proves the crime was not premeditated and Matthew had no previous intent to kill.On Wednesday, the court changed Matthew’s charge to manslaughter but reduced the sentence to seven years rather than two, followed by deportation. Such charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years under UAE law.The UAE has a reputation for having stringent sentencing procedures, with people serving hefty sentences and fines for financial or non-violent crimes, raising concerns by relatives about Matthew’s sentence.Jane’s brother, Peter Manning, accused Dubai’s laws of being “male-biased” and said his sister’s voice was never going to be heard.\\\\\"Dubai judges clearly preferred to defend Francis\\'s pride rather than Jane\\'s life,\\\\\" Manning told The Associated Press after Wednesday’s sentencing.Matthew’s son previously dropped charges against him, and his wife’s father — Jane’s only other next-of-kin — died earlier this year. According to law in the United Arab Emirates, a sentence can be reduced if a victim’s next of kin waives their right to press charges.Matthew and his wife of 30 years were prominent members of the United Arab Emirates’ large British expatriate community.Dubai police were called to the Matthews’ three-bedroom villa in Dubai’s Jumeirah neighborhood on July 4, 2017, where they found Jane dead. Matthew told the police that robbers had broken into the home and killed her.During a later interrogation, however, police say Matthew told them his wife had grown angry with him because they were in debt and needed to move, and that he got angry when she called him a “loser” and told him “you should provide financially.”Matthew told police his wife pushed him during the argument. He then got a hammer, followed her into the bedroom and struck her twice in the head, killing her, according to a police report. The next morning, Matthew tried to make it look like the house had been robbed and later went to work like nothing had happened, throwing the hammer in a nearby trash can, police said. \" ',\n",
       "  ' \" By Jan StrupczewskiBRUSSELS, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Almost half of all Europeans fear climate change more than losing a job or of a terrorist attack, a study by the European Investment Bank (EIB) showed on Thursday as EU lawmakers declared a \\\\\"climate emergency\\\\\".The symbolic vote by lawmakers was designed to pressure for action against global warming at an upcoming United Nations summit..The EIB survey of 30,000 respondents from 30 countries, including China and the United States, showed 47% of Europeans saw climate change as the number one threat in their lives, above unemployment, large scale migration and concerns about terrorism.\\\\\"European citizens are highly concerned about climate change and its impact on their everyday life and future,\\\\\" said Emma Navarro, EIB Vice-President responsible for climate action and the environment.\\\\\"Interestingly, many of them are optimistic about the possibility to reverse it. Unfortunately, science says otherwise. We have one shot at limiting global warming and mitigating its effects,\\\\\" she said.The EIB, owned by European Union governments, is the world\\'s largest international public lending institution and has the task of financing climate-change related investment that is a priority for the new European Commission.The survey, the first of four planned by the EIB, showed the level of concern about climate change was even higher in China than the EU, with 73% of respondents seeing it as the biggest threat to society, compared to 39% in the United States, where most people worried more about access to health services.The study also showed that 41% of young Europeans between the age of 15 and 29, especially from southern countries like Spain, Greece and France thought they would have to move to another country because of the changing climate.\\\\\"Overall, 82% of Europeans report that climate change has an impact on their everyday lives, a perception that goes up to 98% in China and 76% in the United States,\\\\\" the study said.The incoming European Commission, which will start on Dec 1, wants to make the whole of the European Union an area that is neutral in terms of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 after slashing emissions by 50% by 2030. It still requires the consent of all EU governments before such a target becomes binding, but some countries which still heavily depend on coal like Poland, oppose such ambition.

       "  ' \" Key Point: Could this work in a combat scenario?\\xa0China’s H6-K may be an old Soviet-designed bomber—but it’s getting twenty-first century missiles.Chinese H-6Ks—a knockoff of the 1950s Soviet Tu-16 bomber—will be armed with hypersonic weapons, according to Chinese media.“The warplane could eventually be armed with hypersonic weapons that can destroy hostile military hubs 3,000 kilometers [1,864 miles] away within minutes,” said the Global Times news site. “Together with J-20 stealth fighters, H-6Ks could devastate the enemy\\'s fighting capability even before a war gets fully underway.”Wang Ya\\'nan, chief editor of Aerospace Knowledge magazine, told Global Times that while the H-6K is neither fast nor stealthy, it can carry long-range cruise missiles.“The H-6K can remain within a safe zone, launch its missiles that can reach targets 2,000 kilometers away,\\\\\" Wang said. “With China developing hypersonic weapons [missiles that fly at least five times the speed of sound] in recent years, its attack range and speed could become even greater than a conventional cruise missile, potentially capable of taking out targets deep within hostile territories 3,000 kilometers away within just a few minutes.”Assuming that each H-6K can carry six missiles, ten bombers can attack as many as sixty vital military hubs, Wang added.Interestingly, the expert quoted by Chinese media suggested that H-6Ks armed with hypersonic missiles could be paired with J-20 stealth fighters. “The J-20 could partner with the H-6K and clear the sky by shooting down hostile aerial hubs such as early warning aircraft and tanker aircraft, while the H-6K will scorch land hubs such as command centers and missile positions,” Wang told Global Times, which also noted that H-6Ks are already training with unspecified fighters and early warning aircraft.In effect, China is turning an older bomber into a missile truck. The message seems to be that China would target the ground and air infrastructure that would enable American fighters to project power among the vast Pacific expanses: shooting down early warning planes and aerial tankers, and destroying command centers, would disable U.S. airpower as effectively as destroying U.S. aircraft themselves.Read the original article.  \" ',\n",
       "  ' \" A leading Fox News host has issued a bizarre defence of Donald Trump, in which he described the president as a \\\\\"liar\\\\\" and a “full-blown BS artist”.Tucker Carlson said the president makes misleading statements because “that’s who he is” and compared Mr Trump to a “salesman”.“He\\'s a talker, a boaster, a booster, a compulsive self-promoter. At times, he\\'s a full-blown BS artist,” Mr Carlson said.The Fox News presenter also rejected the White House’s claim that Mr Trump’s 2017 inauguration was “the largest ever measured on the national mall”.“We\\'re not going to lie to you: that was untrue,” he added.A Washington Post report published in October found Mr Trump had made more than 13,000 false or misleading claims since taking office in January 2017.However, despite acknowledging that the president often lies, Mr Carlson claimed the media hates him because he “tells the truth”.As an example of the president’s supposed truth-telling, the conservative commentator referred to Mr Trump’s anti-immigration comments during his presidential campaign.In 2015, Mr Trump referred to Mexican immigrants as “rapists” in a sweeping attack on immigration.“When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” he said.“They’re sending people that have lots of problems… They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”However, the majority of studies in the US have found lower crime rates among immigrants compared to non-immigrants, contradicting the perception that immigration increases crime.A 2019 study by The Marshall Project, an online journalism organisation which covers criminal justice, found no causal connection between immigration and crime in the United States.The Fox News presenter ended the segment by mockingly saying: “Let\\'s just agree that Trump is a racist liar and move on.”Mr Carlson, who is a staunch defender of the president, has been repeatedly accused of making sexist and racist comments on TV and radio shows during his career.In August, advertiser started deserting his primetime show after he called white supremacy “a hoax” after the El Paso mass shooting in which 22 people were killed.However, Mr Carlson has been willing to criticise Mr Trump in relation to the Ukraine scandal that is the subject of an ongoing impeachment inquiry.Last month, he admitted Mr Trump should not have pressured Ukraine to investigate his 2020 election rival Joe Biden but stopped short of backing impeachment.

Manley was made aware October 7 of an anonymous email filed with the city detailing the allegations against Newsom, who was one of his top officials. Manley has said he immediately forwarded the email to the police monitor\\'s office, followed up October 24 and received the formal complaint detailing the allegations the following week.\\xa0But Austin Lesbian and Gay Peace Officers Association president Michael Crumrine said Manley should have immediately launched an investigation and placed Newsom on restricted duty, which would have barred him from retiring until the investigation was complete, the Austin-American Statesman reports. Newsom reportedly received a $137,000 in a payout for unused sick time when he stepped down.\\\\\"All the words that you have told us over the years — of doing the right thing, even when it\\'s hard; of having integrity, courage, and accountability — do not match your own actions,\\\\\" Crumrine reportedly said, addressing Manley.Austin\\'s city manager has ordered an outside investigation to determine whether Manley knew about the alleged comments, CBS Austin reports.

       "  ' \" Police officers for the San Francisco Bay Area commuter train system disproportionately target black riders with citations for eating and drinking, according to new data, renewing concerns about racial profiling.The Bay Area Rapid Transit (Bart) data was released following a viral video showing police handcuffing a 31-year-old black man who was cited for eating a breakfast sandwich on his way to work. The new records show that more than 81% of people stopped for eating and drinking on Bart since 2014 were people of color, and that the vast majority of them were black.Stops for eating and drinking on trains or platforms are infrequent within Bart, the train system that runs between San Francisco, Oakland and surrounding suburbs. Of 55 people cited for this offense over the last five years, 33 were black passengers, representing 60% of the citations. Nine of the stops were white passengers, seven were listed as Hispanic, five were categorized as “other” and one was unknown, according to the data, which was obtained by the San Francisco Examiner.Only 10% of Bart’s total riders are black. Ridership data, collected last year, showed that 35% of overall riders are white, 32% are Asian/Pacific Islander and 17% are Latino.Related: San Francisco transit boss apologizes to rider detained over a sandwichBart spokeswoman Alicia Trost said in an email that the data shows citations are “very rare” and are “handed out at stations across the system”.She said: “When an officer witnesses someone eating, they remind the rider that eating is not allowed and if the rider puts the food away no citation is necessary. It is a rare occurrence to need to issue a citation after reminding the rider not to eat.”John Burris, a civil rights lawyer representing Steve Foster, the man stopped in the recent video, said Tuesday that the data was not surprising and was evidence of racial profiling. “This is a form of biased policing, and it’s very harmful to African Americans. Other people eat sandwiches all the time, and they don’t get stopped.”The 15-minute video that received national attention showed a white Bart police officer stopping Foster at the station in Pleasant Hill, north-east of Oakland. The footage showed the officer holding on to Foster’s backpack and telling him he was not free to go until he identified himself and that he was resisting arrest. Backup officers arrived, and Foster was handcuffed and taken away in front of morning commuters.The citation he received required him to pay a $250 fine or do 48 hours of community service.“It was so insulting to him and disturbing,” said Burris. “He was humiliated in front of all the people on Bart.”The video sparked protests and widespread criticism, and Bart leaders eventually apologized and promised to investigate. Bob Powers, Bart’s general manager, said at the time he was “disappointed how the situation unfolded”.A citation or arrest for a minor infraction like eating can escalate to a significantly more serious conflict, said Cat Brooks, the co-founder of the Anti Police-Terror Project in Oakland.“Eating a sandwich is certainly not a reason to throw yet another black body into the criminal justice system,” she said. “We have to hold these cops accountable for racial profiling.”Bart police have long faced scrutiny for brutality and racial profiling, in particular following the 2009 killing of Oscar Grant, an unarmed 22-year-old shot dead on the Fruitvale station platform. There have since been a number of other killings and allegations of abuse by Bart police.Bart should not be citing anyone for eating in the first place, Brooks said.Burris said there should be better training to prevent biased policing, and that it was wrong to handcuff riders for eating.Trost, the Bart spokeswoman, said all officers receive training in “fair and impartial policing, bias-based policing … and de-escalation”.The Bart controversy comes as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in New York is facing intense backlash over a number of viral videos of police, including the arrest of a food vendor selling churros, and an incident in which officers pulled guns on a teenager accused of fare evasion.This article was amended on 27 November 2019 to correct a mathematical error. \" ',\n",

       "  ' \" By Babak DehghanpishehGENEVA (Reuters) - Iran gave a glimpse on Wednesday into the scale of what may have been the biggest anti-government protests in the 40-year history of the Islamic Republic, with an official saying 200,000 people had taken part and a lawmaker saying 7,000 were arrested.Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in his strongest remarks since the unrest peaked, described the two weeks of violence as the work of a \\\\\"very dangerous conspiracy\\\\\".He also said the unrest, initially sparked by fuel price hikes but which then spiraled, had been completely quelled.Iran has given no official death toll, but Amnesty International said this week it had documented the deaths of at least 143 protesters. Tehran has rejected this figure.A number anywhere close to that would make it the deadliest anti-government unrest at least since the authorities put down \\\\\"Green Revolution\\\\\" protests that surrounded the disputed 2009 presidential election, and probably since the 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the shah and swept clerics to power.Details of the unrest have been difficult to report from outside Iran, especially after the authorities shut down the internet for a week.Residents and state media said mobile Internet was restored in the capital Tehran and several other areas on Wednesday, after fixed-line internet was partially reconnected on Monday.The Intelligence Ministry said at least eight people linked to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency had been arrested during the unrest.\\\\\"These elements had received CIA-funded training in various countries under the cover of becoming citizen-journalists,\\\\\" the state news agency IRNA quoted the ministry as saying.\\\\\"Six were arrested while attending the riots and carrying out (CIA) orders, and two while trying to...send information abroad,\\\\\" a ministry statement said.The violence comes as Iran\\'s economy has been hit by tighter U.S. sanctions that have slashed oil exports this year, and as mass demonstrations have erupted in Iraq and Lebanon against governments built around prominent pro-Iran factions.\\\\\"THUGS\\\\\"The Tehran government has blamed \\\\\"thugs\\\\\" linked to its opponents in exile and the country\\'s main foreign foes, namely the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia.Disturbances began on Nov. 15 after the government of the Islamic Republic, one of OPEC\\'s biggest oil producers, announced gasoline price hikes. But protests quickly turned political, with demonstrators demanding the removal of top leaders.\\\\\"A deep, vast and very dangerous conspiracy that a lot of money had been spent on...was destroyed by the people,\\\\\" Khamenei told a meeting with the paramilitary Basij force that took part in the crackdown on protests, his official website said.Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli said 731 banks, 70 petrol stations and 140 government sites had been torched. More than 50 bases used by security forces were attacked, he said, in remarks reported by IRNA.According to IRNA, Rahmani Fazli said up to 200,000 people took part nationwide in the unrest. Hossein Naqavi-Hosseini, a member of parliament\\'s national security committee, said about 7,000 people had been arrested, news website Entekhab reported.Ordinary Iranians have faced an increasingly tough struggle to make ends meet since last year when Washington quit a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and reimposed sanctions on Iran. Under the pact, U.S. and other international sanctions on Iran were eased in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.The U.S. administration says sanctions aim to force Tehran to negotiate a more comprehensive deal, covering everything from its nuclear ambitions to Iran\\'s activities around the Middle East. Iran says it won\\'t hold talks until sanctions are lifted.Daily gasoline consumption has fallen by about 20 million liters a day since prices were hiked, Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said, according to the semi-official ISNA news agency. Daily consumption had been about 98 million liters before the rise, state fuel distribution company NIOPDC said on Tuesday.Washington\\'s policy of imposing \\\\\"maximum pressure\\\\\" has hammered Iran\\'s oil-reliant economy, which has been struggling to deal with rising inflation, growing unemployment, a slumping rial currency and state corruption.The government said the gasoline price rises of at least 50% aimed to raise about $2.55 billion a year to fund extra subsidies for 18 million families on low incomes.(Reporting By Babak Dehghanpisheh with additional reporting by Dubai newsroom; Editing by Paul Tait and Peter Graff/Mark Heinrich) \" ',\n",
       "  ' \" ITHACA, N.Y. – A private investigation into the death of a Cornell University freshman is focused on an alcohol-fueled fraternity party where some students say they got black-out drunk, blurring memories of the last night he was seen alive, the family\\'s attorney said.Newly reported details about Antonio Tsialas’ death in late October came to light after his parents hired private investigators and offered a $10,000 reward for information that reveals what happened.Among the flood of tips are students who suggest Tsialas attended the frat party and traveled with at least one other person to a remote area near Fall Creek in Ithica, according to David Bianchi, an attorney for the parents from Miami.Authorities later recovered Tsialas’ body in a gorge at Fall Creek.“The people who knew him best at Cornell have told us unequivocally that there is no possibility that he would have even known how to get to this place, or gone there on his own,” Bianchi said.Yet in addition to the frat party, another element of the parents\\' search for answers is the history of Cornell student suicides connected to the gorges in Ithaca.The Cornell University Police Department declined to discuss its ongoing investigation of Tsialas’ death. In an initial statement on Oct. 26, the agency noted it didn’t suspect foul play.Bianchi described the police statement as premature and dismissed the possibility that Tsialas took his own life.“There is not a scintilla of a chance that this was a suicide,” Bianchi said.“On the night that he disappeared, he had his last supper with his mother at a restaurant just off campus,” Bianchi added. “We have photographs of the two of them at the restaurant, and they were happy.”Tsialas’ father, John, also spoke about the murky circumstances surrounding the death of an 18-year-old Ivy League student from Coral Gables, Florida,\\xa0with a seemingly bright future ahead.“He was in a very good state of mind, and he was doing well. This is just so confusing to us; there’s more to it than meets the eye,” said John Tsialas, reached by phone last week.“We just want the truth,” he added.Cornell President Martha Pollack has issued two public statements about Tsialas’ death, including one last week that addressed the police probe.She noted the university police agency “followed more than 170 leads and has conducted numerous interviews but has not yet developed a complete picture of the circumstances surrounding Antonio’s death.”Further, Pollack noted Antonio attended an unregistered and unsupervised party at a fraternity the night he was last seen. She added that freshmen were at the party and alcohol was served.Frat deaths: What\\'s going on with fraternity hazing?The day before the party, the frat’s membership had also faced a judicial hearing for prior misconduct, Pollack stated. The frat was placed on interim suspension after Antonio\\'s death, pending a judicial proceeding.“While there are many important benefits to Greek Life at Cornell, there is also a continuing and disturbing pattern of activity that violates our policies and threatens the health and safety of our students,” Pollack stated last week.Fraternity community officials at Cornell voluntarily halted social activities after the death, and Pollack last week announced additional reforms to the Greek system will come before the semester ends.Bianchi identified the fraternity that held the party as Phi Kappa Psi. It didn’t immediately respond to an email and phone call seeking comment about Antonio’s death.It was one of at least four recent cases where young men have died in circumstances apparently related to college fraternities across the country, as families, universities and fraternities are struggling to decide how to address the toxic behavior sometimes associated with these organizations.Many supporters say frats\\' volunteer service, fundraising and sense of community outweigh the bad behaviors. But critics are increasingly drawing connections between the high-profile deaths, putting blame on fraternities\\' culture of hazing.Bianchi asserted Phi Kappa Psi was holding a secret party for freshmen, including Antonio, being considered for membership in the frat.Frat recruitment parties without university approval are commonly called a dirty rush, he said, citing early findings of the private investigation.“A lot of alcohol was served that night to the freshmen by both the membership of the chapter and members of a sorority that were there participating in it,” Bianchi contended.“Some of the freshmen were given so much alcohol that they said they blacked out and have very little recollections of what happened that night,” he added.Antonio was reported missing after failing to meet his parents in Ithaca the morning after the Thursday night frat party. Authorities found his body in the gorge Saturday.John Tsialas last week addressed Antonio’s overall well-being in the days, weeks and months before the party. He described his son as everything from a soccer team and academic standout to a gregarious youth who deeply loved his family.“He was focused on his studies and thinking about internships in the summer time, and he was thinking about his future,” said John Tsialas, recalling talks during regular phone calls with his son.The private investigation also didn’t turn up any red flags that Antonio was in distress after analyzing his computer, according to Bianchi, who added investigators are seeking a cellphone.“When they found Antonio, he had his wallet but his phone was not there, and we don’t know where it is,” Bianchi said.Further evidence of Antonio’s mental state came in the form of more than 300 young people who attended the memorial service, Tsialas said.“He affected so many kids in a positive way, and so many kids were giving stories of how he was so hopeful and happy,” Tsialas said.Antonio\\'s mother, Flavia, expanded on the tragedy in a Facebook post seeking information about the death.\\\\\"Our family is heartbroken and devastated over the loss of our son,\\\\\" she wrote. \\\\\"He was an exceptional young man and a bright scholar. Antonio had done everything right in life and he was fulfilling his dreams at Cornell.\\\\\"She also urged students to come forward with details about the frat party.\\\\\"As a parent we want to know the TRUTH about what happened to him and who was with him that night,\\\\\" she wrote. \\\\\"What occurred at that fraternity party? Who left with Antonio that night? Who was with him when he died? Why was he found so far from his dormitory?\\\\\"One Cornell student’s suicide in 2010 prompted a high-profile lawsuit, which led to the installation of cameras and safety netting intended to discourage and prevent people from jumping into the gorges.The student, Bradley Ginsburg, was also a freshman from Florida eyeing membership in a frat.A straight-A student from Boca Raton, Ginsburg was pledging a fraternity and had never showed signs of mental health problems to his parents or roommate, according to a summary of facts in the case. His body was found Feb. 17, 2010, and he had generated a suicide note the day before.Friends from high school told the Palm Beach Post newspaper that he was homesick but was doing well at Cornell.Reached by phone last week, Bradley’s father, Howard Ginsburg, spoke about the investigation into Antonio’s death and pain of not immediately knowing all the details.The case was ultimately settled for $100,000 from the city and the creation of a Cornell scholarship in his son\\'s name.“I was furious in not knowing what happened, and that to a large extent contributed to my lawsuit because I was kept in the dark,\\\\\" Ginsburg said.Ginsburg noted the depth of his son\\'s depression before the suicide only came into focus after investigators found troublesome writings and music on a computer.\\\\\"I do think that universities all need to take depression a lot more seriously,\\\\\" he said.Meanwhile, the pain of losing his son remains fresh nearly a decade later.\\\\\"Everything is like it happened the day before. It never goes away,\\\\\" Ginsburg said.The early details cited by private investigators looking into Antonio’s case appear to be different than the 2010 suicide.For example, Bradley Ginsburg jumped to his death from a bridge over Fall Creek.Antonio’s case seems to involve a more remote area of Fall Creek away from bridges, safety netting and cameras connected to suicides in the past, according to Bianchi, who criticized Cornell police’s initial public statements for lacking many details.“I don’t know how anyone could say just a couple of days after they found his body that they don’t suspect anything in particular, foul play or otherwise,” Bianchi said.“The right thing to do is to conduct a thorough investigation and wait for it to be fully completed.”This article originally appeared on USA TODAY NETWORK: Antonio Tsialas death investigation is focused on Cornell frat party \" ',\n",

Mastering those qualities is expensive and time-consuming.

As recently as 2016, Biden said he was “not at all” ashamed of his work on the bill, which cracked down on penalties for\\xa0marijuana use, adding that the measure\\xa0“restored American cities.”Democratic presidential contenders\\xa0Cory Booker,\\xa0Elizabeth Warren,\\xa0Bernie Sanders, and Andrew Yang have all said they support legalization of marijuana across the country.During last week’s Democratic primary debate, Booker expressed chagrin that Biden said he is not ready to support legalizing marijuana outright, quipping to the former vice president that, “I thought you might have been high when you said it.” \" ',\n",

       "  ' \" * Supreme Court to hear gun rights case arguments on Monday* Plaintiff in the case had his handgun license suspendedBy Andrew ChungNEW YORK, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Two weeks before Efrain Alvarez and his attorneys asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear their challenge to a New York City regulation that limited where licensed handgun owners could transport their weapons, police officers showed up at his Bronx apartment and took away all his firearms.The officers walked past the bullet-making equipment in his cluttered entranceway and past the trophy deer head hanging on his living room wall. From two imposing steel vaults in the back bedroom, they confiscated around 45 firearms, including five handguns.\\\\\"I\\'m still numb about it,\\\\\" the 64-year-old retired city bus driver said of the August 2018 seizure. \\\\\"It\\'s my lifelong collection.\\\\\"The officers arrested Alvarez, and he was charged with filing a false police report over a claim that one of his handguns had been stolen, a misdemeanor. As a result, Alvarez said, the very handgun license whose transport restrictions he is challenging has been suspended for the second time this decade.The legal battle over the New York measure is the biggest gun rights case at the Supreme Court since 2010, with the justices set to hear arguments next Monday. The challenge is backed by the National Rifle Association, an influential gun rights lobby group closely aligned with Republicans including President Donald Trump, a fellow New Yorker.The regulation restricted transport of handguns by licensed owners to shooting ranges within city limits but allowed hunting during designated seasons. The lawsuit claims the measure violated the U.S. Constitution\\'s Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.After the regulation was amended in July to allow for transporting handguns outside New York City, city officials unsuccessfully asked the Supreme Court to drop the matter and cancel the arguments, asserting that the case was moot.The state\\'s NRA affiliate, the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association, filed the lawsuit in 2013 with Alvarez and two other gun owners as plaintiffs, after authorities told the men that the regulation prevented them from participating at a shooting competition in New Jersey or bringing their guns to second homes elsewhere in the state.Alvarez said he joined the suit because he thought it was ridiculous that he could own a handgun but not travel to compete with it.In the lawsuit, he and the two other gun owners are described as \\\\\"law-abiding residents of New York City.\\\\\" Alvarez does not think his own legal troubles make it awkward or inappropriate for him to challenge the regulation.\\\\\"My suspension has nothing to do with my fight in court,\\\\\" Alvarez said in an interview.Alvarez also said he accepted a deal last week offered by the Bronx district attorney\\'s office to drop the charge in six months if he is not arrested again.Asked about Alvarez\\'s arrest and license suspension, one of the plaintiffs\\' attorneys, Brian Stapleton, said it was the first he had heard of it.\\\\\"It has no impact on this case whatsoever,\\\\\" Stapleton said.Describing himself as a supporter of gun control measures like strong background checks, Alvarez said he hopes the ruling in his case does not undermine other firearms restrictions.\\\\\"If a bad apple grabs a gun and he does something stupid, it kind of falls on me because I\\'m part of what\\'s going on. So it would kind of hit a sore spot,\\\\\" added Alvarez, who said he admires the NRA but disagrees with some of its policies.SUPREME COURT PRECEDENTThe plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court after a lower court found that the regulation did not violate the Second Amendment and advanced the city\\'s interest in protecting public safety.The Supreme Court in 2008 found for the first time that the Second Amendment protects an individual\\'s right to keep a gun in the home for self-defense. In 2010, the court extended that right to state and local laws as well. But the justices have avoided ruling in a major firearms case since then, leaving open questions such as whether that right extends outside the home.\\\\\"I hope that they clarify that the right to posses a firearm outside the home is as important and fundamental as the right to possess one inside the home,\\\\\" Stapleton said.Gun control advocates fear that the conservative-majority Supreme Court could use the case to expand gun rights and threaten a wide array of gun control measures nationwide such as expanded background checks and \\\\\"red flag\\\\\" laws targeting the firearms of people deemed dangerous by the courts.\\\\\"I don\\'t think there\\'s any question that, if given the opportunity, the NRA and its allies will try to re-challenge laws that have already been upheld and certainly challenge any new laws,\\\\\" said Eric Tirschwell, managing director of litigation at Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control lobby group that receives funding from Democratic presidential candidate and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.Born and raised in New York, Alvarez is affable and blunt. He has been a gun enthusiast since serving in the U.S. National Guard decades ago. He said he became an avid hunter and started competitive shooting, winning several awards.His hobby extends to making bullets, reloading spent casings in a mini-workshop that fills the vestibule of his Bronx apartment. He polishes the casings, melts the lead, pours the molds and sets the bullet heads with a pull of the press.Alvarez\\'s August 2018 arrest came after police said he falsely reported a .38 caliber revolver had been stolen by two men he claimed had fooled him by posing as police officers. The saga led police to suspend his handgun license and confiscate his firearms, he said. The New York Police Department declined to discuss Alvarez\\'s case.\\\\\"Everybody who owns a firearm in New York City should have the right to take that firearm to his property, and out of the city to go shooting,\\\\\" Alvarez\\'s said. \\\\\"We\\'re not looking for anything else as far as I\\'m concerned.\\\\\"(Reporting by Andrew Chung; Editing by Will Dunham) \" ',\n",

       "  ' \"  Donald Trump could face formal impeachment charges within weeks after the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee on Tuesday invited the US President to its first impeachment hearing scheduled\\xa0 for December 4.Mr Trump is not required to attend the hearing but the the move allows the president and his legal team access to congressional impeachment procedures that he and other Republicans have denounced as unfair, partly because the White House has not been able to call or cross-examine witnesses.The House Intelligence Committee, which has led the impeachment investigation into Trump’s dealings with Ukraine through weeks of closed-door testimony and televised hearings,is expected to release a formal evidence report shortly after lawmakers return to Congress\\xa0 from their Thanksgiving recess.The Judiciary panel will use the report to consider formal charges that it could recommend for a full House vote by mid-December. It gave Trump until 6 pm\\xa0on Sunday to advise the committee on whether he would attend the hearing, and to indicate by then who would be his counsel.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Representative Jerrold Nadler, the Judiciary Committee’s Democratic chairman, told Trump in a letter that he was reminding the president that the committee’s rules allow him to attend the hearing and for his legal team to question witnesses.The hearing\\xa0 will have legal experts, who have not yet been identified, as witnesses.“The president has a choice to make: he can take this opportunity to be represented in the impeachment hearings, or he can stop complaining about the process,” Nadler said in a statement. “I hope that he chooses to participate.“The impeachment probe is looking into whether Trump abused his power to pressure Ukraine to launch investigations of political rival Joe Biden and a discredited conspiracy theory promoted by Trump that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.In an interview on Tuesday with former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly, Trump denied he directed his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who had been pushing Ukraine for the investigations, to act on his behalf in trying to get Ukraine to help turn up dirt on his political rivals.“No, I didn\\'t direct him, but he is a warrior,” Trump told O\\'Reilly, adding Giuliani “possibly saw something” and “he’s done work in Ukraine for years.\\\\\"Giuliani has said he conducted an investigation into corruption and possible collusion in Ukraine in his role as a defense attorney trying to clear Trump.The inquiry centers on a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Biden, now a leading Democratic presidential contender, and his son Hunter, who had worked for a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president under Democratic President Barack Obama.Democrats have accused Trump of abusing his power by withholding $391 million in security aid to put pressure on a vulnerable U.S. ally to interfere in an American election by digging up dirt on his domestic political opponents.Trump denies wrongdoing and has dismissed the inquiry as a sham by Democrats who want to overturn the result of the 2016 US presidential election.In his letter, Nadler said the hearing was intended as an opportunity to discuss the historical and constitutional basisof impeachment, as well as the meaning of terms like “high crimes and misdemeanors.““We will also discuss whether your alleged actions warrantthe House’s exercising its authority to adopt articles of impeachment,” Nadler wrote.House Republican Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney tweeted that Democrats “have decided to give @realDonaldTrump the right to question liberal law professors, but not any fact witnesses. At all.“The Democratic-led House is aiming to resolve the question of Trump’s impeachment before the end of the year, possibly by approving formal charges known as articles of impeachment and forwarding them to the Republican-controlled Senate for a trial that could begin in January.A trial would determine whether Trump should be convicted and removed from office.But Senate Republicans have shown little inclination to remove Trump, their party’s leader, who is seeking re-election in 2020.On Tuesday, the House Intelligence Committee released transcripts of closed-door testimony from Mark Sandy, a career official with the White House Office of Management and Budget and Philip Reeker, acting assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs.In his testimony, Sandy, one of the only current White House aides to agree to testify to congressional investigators, said a budget office attorney and another staffer in that office resigned partly because of concerns over the hold on U.S.military aid to Ukraine.Reeker in his testimony discussed the “irregular” role three officials close to Trump - the ambassador to the European Union and Trump donor Gordon Sondland, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Giuliani - played in U.S. policy toward Ukraine.A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday found support for impeaching Trump tracked higher over the past few weeks of televised impeachment hearings.According to the poll, which split largely along party lines, 47% of respondents believed Trump should be impeached and 40% were opposed.\\xa0 \" ',\n",

According to Clinton, Gabbard was “the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.”When asked about the comments, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill seemed to confirm that she had been referring to the Russians, when he said, “If the nesting doll fits.” But Clinton later backtracked and insisted she was referring to Republicans, not the Russians, as “grooming” Gabbard.Speaking on Tuesday with stand-up comedian Joe Rogan on “The Joe Rogan Experience,” Gabbard and the host both criticized Clinton for her comments.“When you look at the media establishment pushing a lot of the same narrative and a lot of the same message, then you can see how someone gets away with calling a sitting member of Congress, a candidate for president, a soldier actively serving in the National Guard, veteran of two Middle East deployments, basically a traitor of the country that I love and that I’m willing to lay my life down for,” Gabbard told Rogan. “And to get away with it without any evidence or basis whatsoever.”When Rogan asked how Clinton was able to make her accusation without any evidence to support it, Gabbard blamed the “power of the Clinton machine” and “the power of the political establishment” for allowing Clinton’s accusation to go unchecked.Gabbard is currently polling at below 2 percent of the national Democratic primary vote, according to RealClearPolitics.

       "  ' \" UNITED NATIONS (AP) — A survivor of the mass slaughter of the Yazidi minority in Iraq five years ago told the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday that he still hears his brothers and nephews calling his name before they were killed by Islamic State extremists — and he hears the screams of his wife and three daughters when the militants kidnapped them.The man, who was identified only as Kachi, said he is “still suffering from psychological harm” and “my life is extremely hard.”But Kachi said in a video briefing that he believes he survived, “under a pile of dead bodies ... by God’s will, to be a witness to the hideous crimes committed by the terrorist group” against the Yazidis.He urged the international community not only to ensure that the perpetrators are prosecuted but to “acknowledge that the crimes committed against the Yazidi community amount to genocide.”Kachi spoke at a council meeting on activities of the U.N. investigative team promoting accountability for crimes committed by the Islamic State extremist group in Iraq. Diplomats said he used only his first name for fear of reprisals.Extremists from the Islamic State group, also known as Daesh and ISIL, rampaged through the Sinjar region of northern Iraq in August 2014, destroying villages and religious sites and shooting men and elderly women before kidnapping women and children and selling them in slave markets.Kachi said he was living in Kojo when “terrorist gangs of Daesh took control over Sinjar and its villages” on Aug. 3, 2014.Tens of thousands of Yazidis fled to the Sinjar mountains, but some 7,000 Yazidi women, children and men were killed or captured that day, he said.Kojo was besieged for 12 days, until Aug. 14, 2014, when large numbers of militants entered the village, initially taking people to a school, robbing all their belongings, and then taking all the men — about 400 — to different locations on the outskirts near its orchards and farms, Kachi said.“Later, they started shooting at us while shouting, `God is the greatest, Alahu Akbar,’ while carrying ISIL flags,” he said.When they finished firing, they left for another place, he said.Kachi said he was slightly injured, but alive under a pile of bodies.“When I opened my eyes I saw three of my brothers. They were next to me. They were dead. So were my nephews and cousins,” he said.“I managed to run away for fear of being killed by ISIL,” Kachi said. “I left the remains of my brothers and their children in that mass grave.”“After all the men were killed, ISIL kidnapped the women, girls and children, around 850 of them, took them to the east of Sinjar,” he added.“They separated the elderly women from the rest, around 77 women including my stepmother who was 90 years old. ISIL killed those elderly women or buried them alive in a mass grave,” Kachi said.Then, he said, they took the rest of the women, including his wife and three daughters, and sold them in slave markets in Iraq and Syria.“Today, I speak before you as I have lost around 75 members of my family and my brothers’ families who were killed at the hands of ISIL,” Kachi said.Only 19 of Kojo’s 1,250 residents survived, he said.Even though five years have passed, “I can still remember the remains of my brothers and my nephews. And I can still hear them calling my name ... and I can still hear my wife and my daughters screaming when the members of ISIL kidnapped them.”Kachi said his youngest daughter, Lara, who was 3 months old, died in captivity “because of thirst and hunger.” He did not say where he was speaking from, or what happened to his wife and two other daughters.Despite the rout of Islamic State extremists, Yazidis say they are still unable to return to Sinjar or locate hundreds of their women and children enslaved by the militant group.Karim Khan, who heads the U.N. investigative team, told the Security Council that the courage of survivors who come forward underlines the urgency of the team’s work to help ensure “those who inflicted their suffering will be held accountable.”A year after the team’s arrival in Iraq, he said there has been significant progress in collecting documentary, digital, testimonial and forensic evidence in three priority areas — Mosul, Sinjar and Camp Speicher in Tikrit.Khan said the team’s investigation of attacks on Yazidis in Sinjar has identified “over 160 perpetrators,” and work is now focused on building “case files that may be presented to appropriate courts.”Khan said the team has also assisted the prosecution of two alleged Islamic State members facing war crimes charges in Finland and has been approached by other governments seeking its help.“In a significant development,” he said, “the government of Iraq has also taken purposeful steps towards the introduction of legislation allowing for the prosecution of acts committed by ISIL as war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.” \" ',\n",
       "  ' \" South Korea\\'s top court on Thursday ordered a second retrial for disgraced former president Park Geun-hye, seeking heavier punishment for illegally taking money from the country\\'s spy agency.Park, the country\\'s first female president, was impeached in 2017 after huge street protests over a sprawling scandal, and already faces a separate retrial for corruption and abuse of power that could add to her 25-year jail term.Thursday\\'s ruling came after an appeals court reduced Park\\'s sentence by one year to five years in prison in proceedings for pocketing money from the National Intelligence Service.The Supreme Court said in a statement that the charges dropped on appeal had \\\\\"misunderstood the legal principles\\\\\" and ordered Park \\\\\"should be found guilty\\\\\".The penalties in the two cases apply consecutively, meaning the 67-year-old is currently due to be approaching 100 by the time she is set to be released.Her corruption scandal exposed shady links between big businesses and politics in South Korea, with Park and her close friend Choi Soon-sil accused of taking bribes from conglomerates, including Samsung Electronics, in exchange for preferential treatment.Park\\'s left-leaning successor Moon Jae-in was swept to power by the public backlash against her and her conservative party.South Korean presidents have a tendency to end up in prison after their time in power, usually once their political rivals have moved into the presidential Blue House.All four of South Korea\\'s living presidents have been convicted of criminal offences, although Park\\'s predecessor Lee Myung-bak was granted bail earlier this year.In addition, former president Roh Moo-hyun died of suicide in 2009 after being questioned over graft allegations involving his family. \" '],\n",
